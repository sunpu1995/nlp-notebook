in movies such as a dry white season for which he was again nominated for an oscar in one nine eight nine the freshman in one nine nine zero and don juan demarco in one nine nine five off screen along with his romances and marriages brando s crusades for civil rights the native american rights and other political causes kept him in the public eye throughout his career he married actress anna kashfi in one nine five seven mistakenly believing her to be of asian indian descent when she was in fact from wales and of irish catholic extraction her real name was joan o callaghan o callaghan didn t discourage brando s mistake in fact she dressed and made herself up as an indian beauty after learning that brando gravitated toward exotic women they divorced in one nine five nine after having one

difficult star he was blamed for a change in directors and a runaway budget though he disclaimed responsibility for either the bounty experience affected brando s life in a profound way he fell in love with tahiti and its people he took a nine nine year lease on part of an atoll island tetiaroa which he intended to make part environmental laboratory and part resort tahitian beauty tarita teriipia who had appeared in the film as fletcher christian s love interest became his third wife after he and castaneda were divorced teriipia became the mother of three of his children one of whom died see below the hotel on tetiaroa was eventually built it went through many redesigns due to changes demanded by brando over the years but is now closed a new hotel consisting of three zero deluxe

of brando s was the actor wally cox brando is quoted as saying if wally had been a woman i would have married him and we would have lived happily ever after after cox died in one nine seven three brando kept his ashes for three zero years and they were eventually scattered with his own cox s third wife only discovered he possessed them after reading an interview in time magazine where brando is quoted as saying i have wally s ashes in my house i talk to him all the time she wanted to sue but her lawyers would not accept the case all three of brando s wives were pregnant when he married

tahitian lover of christian s half sister cheyenne at the family s hilltop home above beverly hills christian three one claimed the shooting was accidental after a heavily publicized trial christian was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and use of a gun he was sentenced to one zero years before the sentencing marlon brando delivered an hour of rambling testimony in which he said he and his ex wife had failed christian he commented softly to members of the drollet family i m sorry if i could trade places with dag i would i m prepared for the consequences afterward drollet s father said he thought marlon brando was acting and his son was getting away with murder the tragedy was compounded in one nine nine five when cheyenne said to still be depressed over drollet s death committed suicide by hanging herself in tahiti she was only two five years old brando s notoriety his family s troubled lives his self exile from hollywood and his obesity unfortunately attracted more attention than his late acting career he also earned a reputation for being difficult on the set often unwilling or unable to memorize his lines and less interested in taking direction than in confronting the film director with odd and childish demands on the other hand most other actors found him generous funny and supportive although more and more reclusive in his declining years brando was by nature a casual and friendly man occasionally the public would observe the gargantuan brando stop by will wright s ice cream parlor enjoying his treat seated on two chairs he had pushed together the actor was a long time close friend of the entertainer michael jackson and paid regular visits to his neverland ranch resting there for weeks brando also participated in the singer s solo career three zero th

with his lawyer citing privacy concerns it was later revealed that he died at ucla medical center of lung failure brought on by pulmonary fibrosis he had also been suffering from congestive heart failure and diabetes which was causing his eyesight to fail and had also recently been diagnosed with liver cancer controversy the infamous playboy magazine interview of january one nine seven nine brando was charged with anti semitism in regard to his unfavorable opinion on jewish influence in hollywood you ve seen every single race besmirched but you never saw an unfavorable image of the kike because the jews were ever so watchful for that they never allowed it to be shown on screen brando generally kept his views to himself and withdrew from the public eye in later life brando portrayed george lincoln rockwell the american nazi party leader in the roots the next generation episode in which rockwell gave an interview to alex haley ironically also for playboy trivia brando in one nine

forecasting meteorological phenomena are observable weather events which illuminate and are explained by the science of meteorology those events are bound by the variables that exist in earth s atmosphere they are temperature pressure water vapor and the gradients and interactions of each variable and how they change in time the majority of earth s observed weather is located in the troposphere meteorology climatology atmospheric physics and atmospheric chemistry are sub disciplines of the atmospheric sciences meteorology and hydrology comprise the interdiscplinary field of hydrometeorology history of meteorology early achievements in meteorology aristotle three five zero bc the term meteorology comes from aristotle s meteorology although the term meteorology is used today to describe a subdiscipline of the atmospheric sciences aristotle s work is more general the work touches upon much of what is known as the earth sciences in his own words all the affections we may call common to air and water and the kinds and parts of the earth and the affections of its parts one of the most impressive achievements in meteorology is his description of what is now known as the hydrologic cycle now the sun moving as it does sets up processes of change and becoming and decay and by its agency the finest and sweetest water is every day carried up and is dissolved into vapour and rises to the upper region where it is condensed again by the cold and so returns to the earth one six zero seven galileo galilei constructs a thermoscope not only did this device measure temperature but it represented a paradigm shift up to this point heat and cold were believed to be qualities of aristotle s elements fire water air and earth note there is some controversy about who actually built this first thermoscope there is some evidence for this device being independently built at several different times this is the era of the first recorded meteorological observations as there was no standard measurement they were of little use until the work of daniel gabriel fahrenheit and anders celsius in the one eight th century one six four three evangelista torricelli a contemporary and one time assistant of galileo creates the first man made sustained vacuum in one six four three and in the process creates the first barometer changes in height of mercury in this toricelli tube lead to his discovery that atmospheric pressure changes over time one six four eight blaise pascal discovers that atmospheric pressure decreases with height and deduces that there is a vacuum above the atmosphere one six six seven robert hooke builds an anemometer to measure windspeed one six eight six edmund halley maps the trade winds deduces that atmospheric changes are driven by solar heat and confirms the discoveries of pascal about atmospheric pressure one seven three five george hadley is the first to take the rotation of the earth into account to explain the behavior of the trade winds although the mechanism hadley described was incorrect predicting trade winds half as strong as the actual winds the circulating cells that hadley described later become known as hadley

francis beaufort introduces his system for classifying wind speeds one eight three seven samuel morse invents the telegraph one eight six zero robert fitzroy uses the new telegraph system to gather daily observations from across england and develops synoptic charts allowing predictions to be made at the same time coining the term weather forecast the first ever daily weather forecasts were published by him in the times in one eight six zero and in the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at principal ports when a gale was expected the coriolis effect understanding the kinematics of how exactly the rotation of the earth affects airflow was partial at first late in the one nine th century the full extent of the large scale interaction of pressure gradient force and deflecting force that in the end causes air masses to move along isobars was understood early in the two zero th century this deflecting force was named the coriolis effect after gaspard gustave coriolis who had published in one eight three five on the energy yield of machines with rotating parts such as waterwheels in one eight five six william ferrel proposed the existence of a circulation cell in the mid latitudes with air being deflected by the coriolis force to create the prevailing westerly winds numerical weather prediction a meteorologist at the console of the ibm seven zero nine zero in the joint numerical weather prediction unit c one nine six five early in the two zero th century advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction in one nine two two lewis fry richardson published weather prediction by numerical process which described how small terms in the fluid dynamics equations governing atmospheric flow could be neglected to allow numerical solutions to be found however the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed before the advent of computers at this time in norway a group of meteorologists led by vilhelm bjerknes developed the model that explains the generation intensification and ultimate decay the life cycle of midlatitude cyclones introducing the idea of fronts that is sharply defined boundaries between air masses the group included carl gustaf rossby who was the first to explain the large scale atmospheric flow in terms of fluid dynamics tor bergeron who first determined the mechanism by which rain forms and jacob bjerknes starting in the one nine five zero s numerical experiments with computers became feasible the first weather forecasts derived this way used barotropic that means single vertical level models and could successfully predict the large scale movement of midlatitude rossby waves that is the pattern of atmospheric lows and highs in the one nine six zero s the chaotic nature of the atmosphere was first understood by edward lorenz founding the field of chaos theory these advances have led to the current use of ensemble forecasting in most major forecasting centers to take into account uncertainty arising due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere satellite observation in one nine six zero the launch of tiros one the first successful weather satellite marked the beginning of the age where weather information is available globally weather satellites along with more general purpose earth observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to el ni o in recent years climate models have been developed that feature a resolution comparable to older weather prediction models these climate models are used to investigate long term climate shifts such as what effects might be caused by human emission of greenhouse gases weather forecasting a meteorogist at work at the spc in norman ok meteorologists and weather presenters use several methods to predict what the weather will be like in the future most of these methods were used several decades ago before the seven zero s when computers simply did not exist or were unable to perform fast enough for numerical weather prediction they are used today to estimate the effectiveness of weather forecasting compared to persistence or to climatology analogs were a nightmare one could not find a reasonable match among the infinity of possibilities offered by the atmosphere frontology is used now as a means to describe objects resulting from nwp cold fronts exist but warm fronts are not fronts as such the symbol of warm air struggling against cold air does not represent the reality persistence method the persistence method assumes that conditions will not change often summarised as tomorrow equals today this method works best over short periods of time trends method the trends method involves determining the speed and direction of fronts high and low pressure centers and areas of clouds and precipitation climatology method the climatology method involves using historical weather data collected over long periods of time years to predict conditions on a given date analog method a complex method that involves finding an analog or very similar weather conditions from historical data numerical forecasting method the numerical weather prediction or nwp method uses computers to take into account a large number of variables and creates of computer model of the atmosphere this is the most successful and widely used method meteorology and climatology with the development of powerful new supercomputers like the earth simulator in japan mathematical modeling of the atmosphere can reach unprecedented accuracy this is not only due to the enhanced spatial and temporal resolution of the grids employed but also because these more powerful machines can model the earth as an integrated climate system where atmosphere ocean vegetation and man made influences depend on each other realistically the goal in global meteorological modeling can be termed earth system modeling with a growing number of models of various processes coupled to each other predictions for global effects like global warming and el ni o are expected to benefit substantially from these advancements regional models are attracting more interest as the resolution of global models increases with regional weather disasters such as the elbe flooding in two zero zero two and the european heat wave in two zero zero three decision makers expect from these models accurate assessments about the possible increase of these natural hazards in a specific region countermeasures such as dikes or intentional flooding might be effective in preventing or at least attenuating natural hazards for models at all scales increased model resolution means less reliance on parameterizations which are empirically derived expressions for processes that cannot be resolved on the model grid for example in mesoscale models individual clouds can now be resolved removing the need for formulations that average over a grid box in global modeling atmospheric waves such as gravity waves with short temporal and spatial scales can be represented without resorting to often

i e a usually domesticated animal intending for riding mainly horse and other equines camel elephant or garuda for example the related verb to mount means to sit astride such an animal to mount is to climb or to stand atop something in this sense it can also refer euphemistically to copulation especially between animals a mount is a point where additional equipment such as a weapon camera winch and telescope can be attached to a vehicle so that the vehicle itself supports the weight of the equipment rather than the operator see also turret hard point and pintel a mount is a favourable

short for mountain especially in names such as mount ararat to mount a file system in computer science is to make it ready for use by the operating system typically by reading certain index data structures from storage into memory ahead of time devices may be mounted automatically generally called automounting depending on the operating system see file system microbiology is the study of microorganisms which are unicellular or cell cluster microscopic organisms this includes eukaryotes with a nucleus such as fungi and protists and prokaryotes without a nucleus such as bacteria protozoa and viruses although much is now known in the field of microbiology advances are being made regularly in actual fact the most common estimates suggest that we have studied only about one of all of the microbes in any given environment thus despite the fact that over three hundred years have passed since the discovery of microbes the field of microbiology is clearly in its infancy relative to other biological disciplines such as zoology botany or even entomology history the first bacteria were observed by antony van leeuwenhoek in one six seven six using a single lens microscope of his own design the name bacterium was introduced much later by ehrenberg in one eight two eight derived from the greek word meaning small stick while antony van leeuwenhoek is often cited as the first microbiologist the first recorded microbiological observation that of the fruiting bodies of molds was made earlier in one six six five by robert hooke the field of bacteriology later a subdiscipline of microbiology is generally considered to have been founded by ferdinand cohn one eight two eight one eight nine eight a botanist whose studies on algae and photosynthetic bacteria led him to describe several bacteria including bacillus and beggiatoa cohn was also the first to formulate a scheme for the taxonomic classification of bacteria louis pasteur one eight two two one eight nine five and robert koch one eight four three one nine one zero were contemporaries of cohn s and are often considered to be the founders of medical microbiology louis pasteur is most famous for his series of experiments designed to disprove the then widely held theory of spontaneous generation thereby solidifying microbiology s identity as a biological science pasteur also designed methods for food preservation pasteurization and vaccines against several diseases such as anthrax fowl cholera and rabies robert koch is best known for his contributions to the germ theory of disease proving that specific diseases were caused specific pathogenic microorganisms by the application of what has become known as the koch s postulates koch was one of the first scientists to focus on the isolation of bacteria in pure culture resulting in his discription of several novel bacteria including mycobacterium tuberculosis the causative agent of tuberculosis while louis pasteur and robert koch are often considered the founders of microbiology their work did not accurately reflect the true diversity of the microbial world because of their exclusive focus on microorganisms having medical relevance it was not until the work of martinus beijerinck one eight five one one nine three one and sergei winogradsky one eight five six one nine five three the founders of general microbiology an older term encompassing aspects of microbial physiology diversity and ecology that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed martinus beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture techniques while his work on the tobacco mosaic virus established the basic principles of virology it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation of a wide range of microbes with wildly different physiologies sergei winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential role played by microorganisms in geochemical processes he was responsible for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and nitrogen fixing bacteria types of microbiology the field of microbiology can be generally divided into several subdisciplines microbial physiology the study of how the microbial cell functions biochemically includes the study of microbial growth microbial metabolism and microbial cell structure microbial genetics the study of how genes are organised and regulated in microbes in relation to their cellular functions closely related to the field of molecular biology medical microbiology the study of the role of microbes in human illness includes the study of microbial pathogenesis and epidemiology and is related to the study of disease pathology and immunology veterinary microbiology the study of the role in microbes in veterinary medicine environmental microbiology the study of the function and diversity of microbes in their natural environments includes the study of microbial ecology microbially mediated nutrient cycling geomicrobiology microbial diversity and bioremediation evolutionary microbiology the study of the evolution of microbes includes the study of bacterial systematics and taxonomy industrial microbiology the exploitation of microbes for use in industrial processes examples include industrial fermentation and wastewater treatment closely linked to the biotechnology industry this field also includes brewing an important application of microbiology benefits of microbiology while microbes are often viewed negatively due to their association with many human illnesses microbes are also responsible for many beneficial processes such as industrial fermentation e g the production of alcohol and dairy products antibiotic production and as vehicles for cloning in higher organsisms such as plants scientists have also exploited their knowledge of microbes to produce biotechnologically important enzymes such as taq polymerase reporter genes for use in other genetic systems and novel molecular

bombarding a target of bismuth two zero nine with accelerated nuclei of iron five eight the creation of this element demonstrated that nuclear fusion techniques could be used to make new heavy nuclei the name meitnerium was suggested in honor of the austrian swedish physicist and mathematician lise meitner but there was an element naming controversy as to what the elements from one zero one to one

million bytes megabyte is commonly abbreviated as mb not to be confused with mb which is used for megabits and sometimes as meg definition because of inconsistencies in the use of si derived prefixes such as kilo and mega the exact number can be any one of the following one zero zero zero zero zero zero bytes one zero zero zero two one zero six this is the definition recommended by iec it is used primarily in networking contexts and most storage media particularly hard drives and dvds this definition of mega as a binary prefix is consistent with the other si prefixes and with many other uses of the prefix in computing such as cpu clock speeds or measures of performance one zero four eight five seven six bytes one zero two four two two two zero this definition is used for nearly all discussions of computer memory as computer addresses are naturally powers of two and memory is most easily manufactured in power of two capacities and file storage as of two zero zero five most

number of storage contexts most notably the one four four mb actually one four seven four five six zero bytes three five inch actually nine zero mm high density floppy diskette several attempts to resolve these inconsistencies have been proposed most notably the standard created by the iec to redefine one zero four eight five seven six bytes as a mebibyte this standard has been adopted by several organizations such as the nist and ieee see binary prefix for more information megabytes in use as of two zero zero five the storage capacities of hardware devices such as hard drives are

most personal computers are given as one megabyte one zero four eight five seven six bytes known unambiguously as a mebibyte depending on compression methods and file format a megabyte of data can roughly hold one larger book excluding images one typical sized photograph with reasonably good quality a hundred small images or roughly a minute of compressed music a digital photograph produced by a typical digital camera in two zero zero five might be between one four mb depending on the camera s image resolution and level of compression used until the introduction of hard drives with a capacity of one gigabyte or more the capacity of hard drives was measured in megabytes consumer confusion note that computer memory is addressed in base two due to its design so memory size is always a power of two it is thus convenient to measure in binary units other computer measurements like storage hardware size data transfer rates clock speeds operations per second and so on do not have an inherent base and are measured in the usual decimal units consumers who don t know the meaning of the prefixes often feel shortchanged due to the difference and claim that manufacturers of drives and data transfer devices are using the decimal measurements in an intentionally misleading way to inflate their numbers though these measurements are the norm in all fields other than computer memory and storage for instance if a hard drive is said by a vendor to store one four zero gb of data the disk can store one four zero bytes generally operating systems allocate and report disk and files sizes in binary units and present them using abbreviations e g gb mb kb also used by the decimal system so this drive would be reported as one three zero gb actually one three zero gib some have even sued these manufacturers for deceptive advertising because of the discrepancy regardles the drive wouldn t be able to store files with a total filesize of one three zero gib either due to filesystem overhead see partition computing if the standard iec prefixes were used universally this confusion would be eliminated see binary prefix see also binary prefix kilobyte mebibyte megabit orders of

zero zero disaster those who espouse these theories seldom make clear the nature of ferrat s association with brown on one occasion the two were part of the same trade mission to the c te d ivoire but whether they had known each other before this or remained in contact afterwards is not publicly known the claim that ferrat was scheduled to fly on the plane that killed ron brown has been denied by

restaurant is a type of restaurant that specialises in cheap food for students meter non american spelling metre describes the linguistic sound patterns of verse scansion is the analysis of poetry s metrical and rhythmic patterns prosody is sometimes used to describe poetic meter and indicates the analysis of similar aspects of language in linguistics meter is part of many formal verse forms fundamentals the precise units of poetic meter like rhyme vary from language to language and between poetic traditions often it involves precise arrangements of syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line in english verse the pattern of syllable stress differentiates feet so english meter is founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in latin verse on the other hand while the metrical units are similar not syllable stresses but vowel lengths are the component parts of meter old english poetry used alliterative verse a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line meters in english verse and in the classical western poetic tradition on which it is founded are named by the characteristic foot and the number of feet per line thus for example blank verse is unrhymed iambic pentameter a meter composed of five feet per line in which the kind of feet called iamb s predominate the origin of this tradition of metrics is ancient greek poetry from homer pindar hesiod sappho and the great tragedians of athens technical terms caesura literally a cut or cutting refers to a particular kind of break within a poetic line in latin and greek meter caesura refers to a break within a foot caused by the end of a word in english poetry a caesura refers to a sense of a break within a line caesurae play a particularly important role in old english poetry inversion when a foot of poetry is reversed with respect to the general meter of a poem headless a meter where the first foot is missing its first syllable quantitative see quantitative use in prosody and poetry common feet the most common characteristic feet of english verse are the iamb in two syllables and the anapest in three see foot prosody for a complete list of the metrical feet and their names greek and latin the metrical feet in the classical languages were based on the length of time taken to pronounce each syllable which were categorized as either long syllables or short syllables the foot is often compared to a musical measure and the long and short syllables to whole notes and half notes in english poetry feet are determined by emphasis rather than length with stressed and unstressed syllables serving the same function as long and short syllables in classical meter the basic unit in greek and latin prosody is a mora which is defined as a single short syllable a long syllable is equivalent to two moras a long syllable contains either a long vowel a diphthong or a short vowel followed by two or more consonants various rules of elision sometimes prevent a grammatical syllable from making a full syllable the most important classical meter is the dactylic hexameter the meter of homer and virgil this form uses verses of six feet the first four feet are dactyls but can be spondees the fifth foot is always a dactyl the sixth foot is either a spondee or a trochee the initial syllable of either foot is called the ictus the basic beat of the verse there is usually a caesura after the ictus of the third foot the opening line of the neid is a typical line of dactylic hexameter i sing of arms and the man who first from the shores of troy the first and second feet are dactyls their vowels are grammatically short but long in poetry because both are followed by two consonants the third and fourth feet are spondees with two long vowels one on either side of the caesura the fifth foot is a dactyl as it must be with the ictus this time falling on a grammatically long vowel the final foot is a spondee with two grammatically long vowels the dactylic hexameter was imitated in english by henry wadsworth longfellow in his poem evangeline this is the forest primeval the murmuring pines and the hemlocks bearded with moss and in garments green indistinct in the twilight stand like druids of old with voices sad and prophetic stand like harpers hoar with beards that rest on their bosoms also important in greek and latin poetry is the dactylic pentameter this was a line of verse made up of two equal parts each of which contains two dactyls followed by a long syllable spondees can take the place of the dactyls in the first half but never in the second the long syllable at the close of the first half of the verse always ends a word giving rise to a caesura dactylic pentameter is never used in isolation rather a line of dactylic pentameter follows a line of dactylic hexameter in the elegiac distich or elegiac couplet a form of verse that was used for the composition of elegies and other tragic and solemn verse in the greek and latin world an example from ovid s tristia i only saw vergil greedy fate gave tibullus no time for me the greeks and romans also used a number of lyric meters which were typically used for shorter poems than elegiacs or hexameter one important line was called the hendecasyllabic a line of eleven syllables this meter was used most often in the sapphic stanza named after the greek poet sappho who wrote many of her poems in the form a hendecasyllabic is a line with a never varying structure two trochees followed by a dactyl then two more trochees in the sapphic stanza three hendecasyllabics are followed by an adonic line made up of a dactyl and a trochee this is the form of catullus five one itself a translation of sappho three one x x x x x x ille mi par esse deo videtur x x x x x x ille si fas est superare divos x x x x x x qui sedens adversus identidem te x x x spectat et audit he seems to me to be like a god if it is permitted he seems above the gods he who sitting across from you gazes at you and listens to you the sapphic stanza was imitated in english by algernon charles swinburne in a poem he simply called sapphics saw the white implacable aphrodite saw the hair unbound and the feet unsandalled shine as fire of sunset on western waters saw the reluctant english most english meter is classified according to the same system as classical meter with an important difference english is an accentual language and therefore beats and offbeats stressed and unstressed syllables take the place of the long and short syllables of classical systems in most english verse the meter can be considered as a sort of back beat against which natural speech rhythms vary expressively the number of metrical systems in english is not agreed the major four types are accentual verse accentual syllabic verse syllabic verse and quantitative verse the alliterative verse of old english could also be added to this list or included as a special type of accentual verse accentual verse focuses on the number of stresses in a line while ignoring the number of offbeats and syllables accentual syllabic verse focuses on regulating both the number of stresses and the total number of syllables in a line syllabic verse only counts the number of syllables in a line quantitative verse regulates the patterns of long and short syllables this sort of verse is often considered alien to english the most frequently encountered line of english verse is the iambic pentameter in which the metrical norm is five iambic feet per line though metrical substitution is common and rhythmic variations practically inexhaustible john milton s paradise lost most sonnets and much else besides in english are written in iambic pentameter lines of unrhymed iambic pentameter are commonly known as blank verse blank verse in the english language is most famously represented in the plays of william shakespeare although it is also notable in the work of tennyson e g ulysses the princess a rhymed pair of lines of iambic pentameter make a heroic couplet a verse form which was used so often in the eighteenth century that it is now used mostly for humorous effect although see pale fire for a non trivial case another important meter in english is the ballad meter also called the common meter which is a four line stanza with two pairs of a line of iambic tetrameter followed by a line of iambic trimeter the rhymes usually fall on the lines of trimeter although in many instances the tetrameter also rhymes this is the meter of most of the border and scots or english ballads it is called the common meter in hymnody as it is the most common of the named hymn meters used to pair lyrics with melodies and provides the meter for a great many hymns such as amazing grace amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me i once was lost but now am found was blind but now i see another poet who put this form to use was emily dickinson great streets of silence led away to neighborhoods of pause here was no notice no dissent no universe no laws old english poetry has a different metrical system in old english poetry each line must contain four fully stressed syllables which often alliterate the unstressed syllables are less important old english poetry is an example of the alliterative verse found in most of the older germanic languages french in french poetry meter is determined solely by the number of syllables in a line a silent e counts as a syllable except before a sounded vowel or at the end of a line the most frequently encountered meter in french is a line of two times six feet separated by a caesura called the alexandrine classical french poetry also had a complex set of rules for rhymes that goes beyond how words merely sound these are usually taken into account when describing the meter of a poem spanish in spanish poetry meter is determined solely by the number of syllables in a line syllables in spanish metrics are determined by consonant breaks not word boundaries thus a single syllable may span multiple words for example the line de armas y hombres canto consists of six syllables dear ma syhom bres can to note how the vowel sounds in adjacent words combine into a single unit as in the third syllable of the line de arma s y hom bres canto some common meters in spanish verse are septenary a line consisting of seven syllables the sixth being always stressed octosyllable a line consisting of eight syllables the seventh always being stressed this meter is commonly used in romances narrative poems similar to english ballads hendecasyllable a line consisting of eleven syllables the sixth and the tenth or the fourth the eighth and the tenth always being stressed this meter plays a similar role to pentameter in english verse it is commonly used in sonnets among other things alexandrines a line consisting of two heptasyllables italian in italian poetry meter is determined solely by the position of the last accent in a line syllables are enumerated with respect to a verse which ends with a paroxytone so that a septenary literally having seven syllables is defined as a verse whose last accent falls on the sixth syllable it may so contain eight syllables ei fu siccome immobile or just six la terra al nunzio sta moreover when a word ends with a vowel and the next one starts with a vowel they are considered to be in the same syllable so gli anni e i giorni consists of only four syllables gli an ni e i gior ni because of the mostly trochaic nature of the italian language verses with an even number of syllables are far easier to compose and the novenary is usually regarded as the most difficult verse some common meters in italian verse are septenary a line whose last stressed syllable is the sixth one octosyllable a line whose last accent falls on the seventh syllable more often than not the secondary accents fall on the first third and fifth syllable especially in nursery rhymes for which this meter is particularly well suited hendecasyllable a line whose last accent falls on the tenth syllable it therefore usually consists of eleven syllables there are various kinds of possible accentations it is used in sonnets in ottava rima and in many other works the divine comedy in particular is composed entirely of hendecasyllables dissent not all poets accept the idea that meter is a fundamental part of poetry many twentieth century american poets including marianne moore william carlos williams and robinson jeffers believed that meter was imposed into poetry by man and is not a fundamental part of its nature in an essay titled robinson jeffers poet critic dan schneider writes what if someone actually said to you that all music was composed of just two notes or if someone claimed that there were just two colors in creation now ponder if such a thing were true imagine the clunkiness jeffers came up with a technique he called rolling stresses marianne moore went even further than jeffers openly declaring her poetry was written in syllabic form and wholly denying meter her famous poem poetry illustrate her contempt for meter and her syllabic style william carlos williams preferred to write in what he called colloquial idioms he came up with the concept of the variable foot gerard manley hopkins claimed most poetry was written in a rhythmic structure inherited from the norman side of the english literary heritage based on repeating groups of two or three syllables with the stressed syllable falling in the same place on each repetition hopkins called this structure running rhythm he became fascinated with older rhythmic structures in the anglo saxon tradition which he called sprung rhythm sprung rhythm is structured around feet with a variable number of syllables generally between one and four syllables per foot with the stress always falling on the first syllable in a foot notes for example robert

cheaper per copy than any other process in runs of several hundred to several thousand copies it was not capable of photocopying a document as a special stencil had to be prepared by hand popular until the early one nine nine zero s especially in the preparation of tests and notes for use in classrooms it has been largely supplanted by photocopying and offset printing it used waxed tissue paper stencils these were placed in a typewriter to create the original the impact of the typewriter key displaced the wax making the tissue paper permeable to the oil based ink the stencil was wrapped around the drum of the manual or electrical machine which was filled with ink when a blank sheet of paper was drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller ink was forced out through the marks on the stencil the paper had a surface texture like bond paper and the ink was usually black although green and red inks were available a special ball tipped stylus could be used to cut stencils by hand against a patterned plastic card but one had to write carefully or else a loop would likely tear a hole in the tissue paper resulting in a black blob being printed mistakes could be corrected by applying correction fluid wax dissolved in a solvent known as corflu and obliterine the latter being a former australian trademark with a small brush then re typing over it if one put the stencil on the drum wrong side out one s copies came out mirror imaged the process was messy and ink would often get on one s hands and the pressure roller in addition the striking surface of the letters on the typewriter would quickly become clogged with wax the closed letter forms such as o or b making a stencil cut that resulted in black blobs instead of white space in the center another device called an electrostencil machine could make mimeo stencils from an already printed original it worked by scanning the original on a rotating drum with a moving optical head and burning through the blank stencil with an electric spark in the places where the optical head detected ink it was slow and filled the air with ozone and other pollutants and copies produced from electrostencils had worse quality less sharpness to the letters than copies made from typed stencils a skilled mimeo operator using an electrostencil and a very coarse half tone screen could make acceptable printed copies of a photograph this took considerable care both in preparing the stencil and in maintaining evenness of the ink flow during printing during the declining years of the mimeograph some people made stencils with computers and dot matrix impact printers gestetner risograph and other companies still make and sell highly automated mimeograph like machines externally similar to photocopiers as the mimeo process is faster and less expensive than xerography for moderate to large print runs although the image quality is inferior the modern version of a mimeograph is called a digital duplicator and contains a scanner a thermal head for stencil cutting and a large roll of stencil material entirely inside the unit making the stencils and mounting and unmounting them from the print drum automatically making it almost as easy to operate as a photocopier risographs are the best known of these machines origins of the mimeograph thomas edison received us patent one eight zero eight five

obtained a further patent us two two four six six five method of preparing autographic stencils for printing which covered the making of stencils using a file plate a grooved metal plate on which the stencil was placed which perforated the stencil when written on with a blunt metal stylus edison did not coin the word mimeograph which was first used by albert blake dick when he licensed edison s patents in one eight eight seven others who worked concurrently on the development of stencil duplicating were eugenio de zaccato and david gestetner both in britain the term mimeograph was originally protected as a trademark however over time the term became generic and is now an example of a genericized trademark roneograph also roneo machine was another trademark used for mimeograph machines mimeographs were used extensively in the production of fanzines in the middle two zero th century before photocopiers became widespread in sufficient quantities however they are still more economical certain typographical practices were peculiar to mimeographical publication due to the tendency of the stencil to tear thus becoming useless underlining was neither used in spaces nor on the letters with descenders the expression of irony by crossing out letters was done with a forward slash not a hyphen this differs from the method in hypertext penelope rosemont pioneered a surrealist technique of peeling the backing away from the stencil to create a mimeogram see also duplicating machines list of duplicating processes spirit duplicator a k a ditto machine office equipment printing a meteorite is a small extraterrestrial body that impacts the earth s surface while in space they are called meteoroids and while falling through earth s atmosphere they are called meteors these are small asteroids approximately boulder sized or less when it enters the atmosphere air drag and friction cause the body to heat up and emit light thus forming a fireball or shooting star more generally

with considerable force leaving behind an impact crater the kind of crater will depend on the size composition degree of fragmentation and incoming angle of the meteor the force of collision may cause widespread destruction occasional damage to property livestock and even people has been recorded in historic times in the case of comet fragments which are largely composed of ice a considerable concussion may occur even though no fragment of the original meteoroid survives the famed tunguska event is thought to have resulted from such an incident seven nine of meteorites are chondrites balls of mafic minerals with small grain size indicative of rapid cooling in most chondrites small spherules called chondrules can be found chondrites are typically about four six billion years old and are thought to represent material from the asteroid belt it is unknown how they formed carbonaceous chondrites thought to be unaltered solar nebula material constitute about five of meteorites and contain small amounts of organic materials including amino acids also presolar grains are identified in carbonaceous chondrites the isotope ratios of carbonaceous chondrites are similar to those of the sun slice of meteorite on display at the vanderbilt museum new york achondrites are similar to terrestrial mafic igneous rocks and sometimes are brecciated achondrites constitute about eight of the incoming material and are thought to represent crustal material of some of the larger asteroids mostly four vesta and occasionally mars about six of meteorites are iron meteorites with intergrowths of iron nickel alloys such as kamacite unlike chondrites the crystals are large and appear to represent slow crystallization iron meteorites are thought to be the core material of one or more planets that subsequently broke up stony iron meteorites constitute the remaining two they are a mixture of iron nickel and silicate minerals they are thought to have originated in the boundary zone above the core regions where iron meteorites originated a small number of meteorites belong to additional groups or subgroups with unique chemical characteristics relative to other members of the larger groups such as lunar meteorites or martian meteorites tektites from greek tektos molten natural glass objects up to a few centimeters in size were formed according to most scientists by the impact of large meteorites on earth s surface although a few researchers favor an origin from the moon as volcanic ejecta a classification of meteorite types can be found here one theory stipulates that a large meteorite impact caused the mass extinction of the dinosaurs it is also theorized that meteorites caused other mass extinction events as well throughout the history of the earth the willamette

production of consonants for any place of articulation there may be several manners and therefore several homorganic consonants one parameter of manner is stricture that is how closely the speech organs approach one another parameters other than stricture are those involved in the ar sounds taps and trills and the sibilancy of fricatives often nasality and laterality are included in manner but phoneticians such as peter ladefoged consider them to be independent stricture from greatest to least stricture speech sounds may be classified along a cline as stop consonants with occlusion or blocked airflow fricative consonants with partially blocked and therefore strongly turbulent airflow approximants with only slight turbulence and vowels with full unimpeded airflow affricates often behave as if they were intermediate between stops and fricatives but phonetically they are sequences of stop plus fricative historically sounds may move along this cline toward less stricture in a process called lenition other parameters sibilants are distinguished from other fricatives by the shape of the tongue and how the airflow is directed over the teeth fricatives at coronal places of articulation may be sibilant or non sibilant with sibilants more common taps and flaps are similar to very brief stops however their articulation and behavior is distinct enough to be considered a separate manner rather than just length trills involve the vibration of one of the speech organs since trilling is a separate parameter from stricture the two may be combined increasing the stricture of a typical trill results in a trilled fricative trilled affricates are also known nasal airflow may be added as an independent parameter to any speech sound it is most commonly found in nasal stops and nasal vowels but nasal fricatives taps and approximants are also found when a sound is not nasal it is called oral an oral stop is often called a plosive while a nasal stop is generally just called a nasal laterality is the release of airflow at the side of the tongue this can also be combined with other manners resulting in lateral approximants the most common lateral flaps and lateral fricatives and affricates individual manners plosive or oral stop where there is complete occlusion blockage of both the oral and nasal cavities of the vocal tract and therefore no air flow examples include english p t k voiceless and b d g voiced if the consonant is voiced the voicing is the only sound made during occlusion if it is voiceless a plosive is completely silent what we hear as a p or k is the effect that the onset of the occlusion has on the preceding vowel and well as the release burst and its effect on the following vowel the shape and position of the tongue the place of articulation determine the resonant cavity that gives different plosives their characteristic sounds all languages have plosives nasal stop usually shortened to nasal where there is complete occlusion of the oral cavity and the air passes instead through the nose the shape and position of the tongue determine the resonant cavity that gives different nasal stops their characteristic sounds examples include english m n nearly all languages have nasals the only exceptions being in the area of puget sound and a single language on bougainville island fricative sometimes called spirant where there is continuous frication turbulent and noisy airflow at the place of articulation examples include english f s voiceless v z voiced etc most languages have fricatives though many have only an s however the australian languages are almost completely devoid of fricatives of any kind sibilants are a type of fricative where the airflow is guided by a groove in the tongue toward the teeth creating a high pitched and very distinctive sound these are by far the most common fricatives fricatives at coronal front of tongue places of articulation are usually though not always sibilants english sibilants include s and z lateral fricatives are a rare type of fricative where the frication occurs on one or both sides of the edge of the tongue the ll of the welsh language and the hl of zulu are lateral fricatives affricate which begins like a plosive but this releases into a fricative rather than having a separate release of its own the english letters ch and j represent affricates affricates are quite common around the world though less ubiquitous than fricatives flap often called a tap is a momentary closure of the oral cavity the tt of utter and the dd of udder are pronounced as a flap in north american english many linguists distinguish taps from flaps but there is no consensus on what the difference might be no language relies on such a difference there are also lateral flaps trill in which the articulator usually the tip of the tongue is held in place and the airstream causes it to vibrate the double r of spanish perro is a trill trills and flaps where there is one or more brief occlusions constitute a class of consonant called rhotics approximant where there is very little obstruction examples include english w and r in some languages such as spanish there are sounds which seem to fall between fricative and approximant one use of the word semivowel is a type of approximant pronounced like a vowel but with the tongue closer to the roof of the mouth so that there is slight turbulence in english w is the semivowel equivalent of the vowel u and j spelled y is the semivowel equivalent of the vowel i in this usage other descriptions use semivowel for vowel like sounds that are not syllabic but don t have the increased stricture of approximants these are found as elements in diphthongs the word may also be used to cover both concepts lateral approximants usually shortened to lateral are a type of approximant pronounced with the side of the tongue english l is a lateral together with the rhotics which have similar behavior in many languages these form a class of consonant called liquids broader classifications manners of articulation with substantial obstruction of the airflow plosives fricatives affricates are called obstruents these are prototypically voiceless but voiced obstruents are extremely common as well manners without such obstruction nasals liquids approximants and also vowels are called sonorants because they are nearly always voiced voiceless sonorants are uncommon but are found in welsh and classical greek the spelling rh in tibetan the lh of lhasa and the wh in those dialects of english which distinguish which from witch sonorants may also be called resonants and some linguists prefer that term restricting the word sonorant to non vocoid resonants that is nasals and liquids but not vowels or semi vowels another common distinction is between stops plosives and nasals and continuants all else affricates are considered to be both because they are sequences of stop plus fricative other airstream initiations all of these manners of articulation are pronounced with an airstream mechanism called pulmonic egressive meaning that the air flows outward and is powered by the lungs actually the ribs and diaphragm other airstream mechanisms are possible sounds which rely on some of these include ejectives which are glottalic egressive that is the airstream is powered by an upward movement of the glottis rather than by the lungs or diaphragm plosives affricates and occasionally fricatives may occur as ejectives all ejectives are voiceless implosives which are glottalic ingressive here the glottis moves downward but the lungs may be used simultaneously to provide voicing and in some languages no air may actually flow into the mouth implosive oral stops are not uncommon but implosive affricates and fricatives are rare voiceless implosives are also rare clicks which are velaric ingressive here the back of the tongue is used to create a vacuum in the mouth causing air to rush in when the foreward occlusion tongue or lips is released clicks may be oral or nasal stop or affricate central or lateral voiced or voiceless they are extremely rare in normal words outside southern africa however english has a click in its tsk tsk or tut tut sound and another is used to say giddy up to a horse see also place of articulation phonation airstream mechanism list of phonetics topics

arose in mid one six th century in part it arose in reaction to the high renaissance emerging after the sack of rome in one five two seven shook renaissance confidence humanism and rationality to their foundations and even religion had split apart like modernism the term is one of the few style designations whose label was self applied it comes from the italian maniera or style in the sense of an artist s characteristic touch or recognizable manner giorgio vasari frontispiece to lives of the artists one five six eight mannerism was initially a contentious stylistic label among art historians when it resurfaced before world war i first used by german art historians like heinrich w lfflin to categorize the seemingly uncategorizable art of the italian one six th century the style that introduced the renaissance to france in the fontainebleau schools and to antwerp in quite another manner styles that were neither renaissance nor baroque mannerism is not easily pigeonholed it scarcely affected the popular arts and no definitions survived much examination in the views of english art historians partly perhaps because they already had sufficient local categories elizabethan drama jacobean architecture and furniture the framing of the engraved frontispiece to mannerist artist giorgio vasari s lives of the artists illustration right would be called jacobean in an english speaking context in it michelangelo s medici tombs inspire the anti architectural architectural features at the top the papery pierced frame the satyr nudes at the base in the vignette of florence at the base papery or vellum like material is cut and stretched and scolled into a cartouche cartoccia the design is self conscious overcharged with rich artificially natural detail in physically improbable juxtapositions of jarring scale changes overwhelming as a mere frame mannerist vasari s own opinions about the art of creating art come through in his praise of fellow artists in the great book that lay behind this frontispiece he believed that excellence in painting demanded refinement richness of invention invenzione expressed through virtuoso technique maniera and wit and study that appeared in the finished work all criteria that emphasized the artist s intellect and the patron s sensibility the artist was now no longer just a craftsman member of a local guild of st luke now he took his place at court with scholars poets and humanists in a climate that fostered an appreciation for elegance and complexity the coat of arms of vasari s medici patrons appear at the top of his portrait quite as if they were the artist s own mannerism is usually set in opposition to high renaissance conventions it was not that artists despaired of achieving the immediacy and balance of raphael it was that such balance was no longer relevant or appropriate mannerism developed among the pupils of two masters of the integrated classical moment with raphael s assistant giulio romano and among the students of andrea del sarto whose studio produced the quintessentially mannerist painters pontormo and rosso fiorentino and with whom vasari apprenticed baptism by el greco after the realistic depiction of the human form and the mastery of perspective achieved in high renaissance classicism some artists started to deliberately distort proportions in disjointed irrational space for emotional and artistic effect there are aspects of mannerism in el greco illustration left in spite of the uniquely individual quality that sets him apart from simple style designations you can detect mannerism in el greco s jarring acid color sense his figures elongated and tortured anatomy the irrational perspective and light of his breathless and crowded composition and obscure and troubling iconography in italy mannerist centers were rome florence and mantua venetian painting in its separate school pursued a separate course epitomized in the long career of titian two works one practical one metaphysical by gian paolo lomazzo helped define the mannerist artist s self conscious relation to his art his trattato dell arte della pittura scoltura et architettura milan one five eight four is in part a guide to contemporary concepts of decorum which the renaissance inherited in part from antiquity but mannerism elaborated upon which controlled a consonance between the functions of interiors and the kinds of painted and sculpted decors that would be suitable in lomazzo s systematic codification of esthetics which typifies the more formalized and academic approaches typical of the later one six th century iconography often convoluted and abstruse is a more prominent element in the mannersist styles lomazzo s less practical and more metaphysical idea del tempio della pittura the ideal temple of painting milan one five nine zero offers a description along the lines of the four temperaments theory of the human nature and personality containing the explanations of the role of individuality in judgment and artistic invention some mannerist examples jacopo da pontormo s joseph in egypt stood in what would have been considered contradicting colors and disunified time and space in the renaissance neither the clothing nor the buildings not even the colors accurately represented the bible story of joseph it was wrong but it stood out as an accurate representation of society s feelings susanna and the elders alessandro allori one five three five one six zero seven waxy eroticism and consciously brilliant still life detail in a crowded contorted composition rosso fiorentino who had been a fellow pupil of pontormo in the studio of andrea del sarto brought the florentine maniera to fontainebleau in one five three zero where he became one of the founders of the french one six th century mannerism called the school of fontainebleau the examples of a rich and hectic decorative style at fontainebleau transferred the italian style through the medium of engravings to antwerp and thence throughout northern europe from london to poland and brought mannerist design into luxury goods like silver and carved furniture a sense of tense controlled emotion expressed in elaborate symbolism and allegory and elongated proportions of female beauty are characteristics of his style agnolo bronzino s somewhat icy portraits put an uncommunicative abyss between sitter and viewer concentrating on rendering of the precise pattern and sheen of rich textiles jacopo tintoretto s last supper epitomized mannerism by taking jesus and the table out of the middle of the room he showed all that was happening in sickly disorienting colors he painted a scene of confusion that somehow separated the angels from the real world he had removed the world from god s reach el greco attempted to express the religious tension with exaggerated mannerism this exaggeration would serve to cross over the mannerist line and be applied to classicism benvenuto cellini created a salt cellar of gold and ebony in one five four zero featuring neptune and amphitrite earth and water in elongated form and uncomfortable positions it is considered a masterpiece of mannerist sculpture

clear example of the exuberance of antwerp mannerism an example of mannerist architecture is the villa farnese at caprarola in the rugged country side outside of rome the proliferation of engravers during the one six th century spread mannerist styles more quickly than any previous styles a center of mannerist design was antwerp during its one six th century boom antwerp mannerism was the form

engage in sexual relations lewinsky s testimony to the starr commission however contradicted clinton s claim of being totally passive in their encounters clinton s lawyer would later explain that different people can remember the same events in different ways clinton was impeached by the house of representatives but not convicted in the senate so he was not removed from office interestingly

school of economics a manometer is a pressure measuring instrument often also called pressure gauge description the oldest type is the liquid column manometer a very simple version is a u shaped tube half full of liquid where the measured pressure is applied to one side of the tube whilst the reference pressure which might be of the atmosphere is applied to the other the difference in liquid level represents the applied pressure it is quite easy to make a homemade manometer for low pressure differences water is a commonly used liquid and inches of water is a commonly used pressure unit for larger pressure differences the greater density of mercury makes it more useful a single limb liquid column manometer has a larger reservoir instead of one side of the u tube and has a scale beside the narrower column the column may be inclined to further amplify the liquid movement liquid column manometers can be used to measure small differences between great pressures membrane type manometer a second type uses the deflection of a flexible membrane that seals a fixed pressure reference volume to determine the pressure the amount of deflection is repeatable for known pressures so the pressure can be determined using a lookup table a third variant bourdon gauge uses a coiled tube which as it expands due to pressure increase causes a rotation of an arm connected to the tube one use of manometers is to measure vacuum pressures especially in the range from zero zero zero one atmospheres to one atm they are helpful because the deflection of the manometer is not dependent upon the type of gas being measured unlike other types of vacuum gauges in this pressure range the deflection of the piston is often one half of a capacitor so that when the piston moves the capacitance of the device changes this is a common way with proper calibrations to get a very precise electronic reading from a manometer and this configuration is called a capacitive manometer vacuum gauge for very low pressures high vacuums aka hard vacuums entirely electronic means ion gauges are used to measure the quality of the vacuum european cen standard en four seven two pessure gauge vocabulary en eight

from the city in the bubblegum crisis anime series megatokyo frequently uses l three three t speak and some argue that the comic helped to introduce that style to a more mainstream audience plot strip six one nine depicting piro largo sonoda yuki and nanasawa kimiko published on october eight two zero zero four megatokyo follows the story of two americans piro and largo who are stuck in tokyo and are unable to get home the two protagonists are based on megatokyo s two creators or their online personas but are fictional characters with lives of their own piro is a shy and somewhat under confident person who cherishes japanese pop culture including manga anime and dating sim games largo the more extroverted of the pair is obsessed with building high end computers and playing games on them somewhat unable to distinguish between the fictional and the real world he sees elements from his games in everything around him like a modern day don quixote the two arrive in tokyo after an incident at the e gaming exposition and find themselves with no money to buy plane tickets home after living for awhile in the apartment of a japanese friend of piro s they are eventually forced to make an independent living in japan piro finds work at a computer game store called megagamers while largo takes on somewhat irregular jobs with the police and as an english teacher at a local high school megatokyo s pace and style indirectly correspond to the history of the comic itself much of the early humor consists of video game culture jokes as well as culture clash issues during this early phase the story moved along at a haphazard pace and was often interrupted by pure gag episodes and dead piro days this changed over time with the greatest changes coming after gallagher completely took over megatokyo the comic features aspects from a number of different anime and manga archetypes usually making light of the genre s various clich s junpei a ninja who takes on largo as

property in the u s volume three s highest ranking in bookscan is three ending february two zero two zero zero five this makes it the best showing for an american manga criticism and praise megatokyo has been subject to much analysis from webcomic fans some critics dislike its slow pace and apparent lack of clear direction or resolution for the many plot threads that run through the megatokyo story this perception is exacerbated by the often erratic update schedule gallagher has occasionally resorted to filler art days strips with other authors and artists with no continuity with any storylines or guest comics in order to prevent the front page content from appearing too stagnant commonly done with many webcomics the complaints about the speed of updates have even prompted gallagher to install an update progress bar for readers waiting for the next installment as a story oriented comic megatokyo has a large supporting cast as well as several storylines at any given point in time however there are no on site aids for the uninitiated confused or forgetful the megatokyo website has had story and cast pages which have been under construction for several years and that still bear nothing more than a single remark i ll finish this section when i feel like it a number of fans have created their own resource sites including plot guides and character pages indicating a need for such resources professionally gallagher is now working full time on megatokyo he was one of the first webcomic artists to have the ability to profit from his hobby but with this change the customary complaint about the speed of updates was renewed with gallagher s full time status the criticism is that updates should be more frequent than when gallagher was only working on the comic part time artistically megatokyo is often praised for its intricate pencil work done entirely in grayscale without either digital or physical inking and inspired character design while fans of the comic s story often point to the realistic reactions and emotions of the people piro interacts with gallagher has been criticized for an uniformity of appearance and simple design of his characters particularly with his female faces which some say are identical with hairstyle and attire as the only distinguishing features conversely it is noted that gallagher takes great care in costuming choices hair and other design elements originally the strip was known for a frenetic sense of humor with a greater emphasis on slapstick video game humor and gag a day format in the years after rodney caston left megatokyo has evolved into a very different kind of webcomic focusing less on the humor that defined it in the beginning this has lead to a section of former fans feeling that megatokyo was better when caston was writing it additionally without caston s input it has been said that caston s alter ego largo s violent gamer antics appear forced and seem to be just an afterthought on gallagher s part others say that this means that it is no longer a humorous strip and more of a traditional bishoujo many people also note the frequent existence of gallagher s dead piro days and other ways to avoid having to produce the comic on an actual schedule some feel that caston s departure signalled an end to a constant running story further complicating the issue some of gallagher s critics say there are suggestions that piro is or could be in questionable relationships with underage japanese schoolgirls however this is a tenuous interpretation of one of the running sub stories and something negatively mentioned within the comic by the character seraphim this latter criticism is related with the common complaint that under gallagher s direction megatokyo is being somewhat more of a bishoujo series the kind which gallagher himself is so interested in and is simply reflecting the trends in that arguably buffering some complaints is the sense of humility gallagher typically gives off which has been playfully parodied in other webcomics indeed some fans who are not particularly fond of the webcomic feel mockery of the strip is a kind of old meme history the comic was started as a joint project of gallagher and his friend and later business partner rodney caston with caston writing the scripts and gallagher supplying the artwork caston sold off his ownership of the company in may two zero zero two since then the comic has been managed entirely by fred gallagher in october two zero zero two gallagher was laid off from his day job as an architect and he has since taken the comic as a full time job rodney caston s departure from megatokyo was not fully explained at the time initially gallagher and caston only briefly mentioned the split with the news of it publicly announced when gallagher posted a news post officially announcing caston s departure on january one five two zero zero five fred explained his version of the reasons for the split in response to what he felt was a mean spirited comment by scott kurtz of pvp where kurtz implied that gallagher had stolen megatokyo from caston while things were good at first over time we found that we were not working well together creatively there is no fault in this it happens i ve never blamed rodney for this creative falling out nor do i blame myself not all creative relationships click ours didn t in the long run four days later rodney posted his version of the event on his website after this he approached me and said either i would sell him my ownership of megatokyo or he would simply stop doing it entirely and we d divide up the company s assets and end it all this was right before the mt was to go into print form and i really wanted to see it make it into print rather then sic die on the vine changes originally megatokyo was laid out in four square panels per strip in a two by two square array as a compromise between the horizontal layout of american comic strips and the vertical layout of japanese comic strips soon the limitations of this format became apparent and the comic changed into a manga styled free form layout which allows for both large detailed drawings and small abstract progressions as the needs of the script require this change happened in the spring of two zero zero one during chapter zero and the first year of

do not even read the webcomic but the forums are also home to an active community of fans they have spawned numerous fan operated websites several wikis and several irc channels there are an estimated

manuscript the term medieval music encompasses european music written during the middle ages this era begins with the fall of the roman empire four seven six ad and ends in approximately the middle of the fifteenth century establishing the end of the medieval era and the beginning of the renaissance is admittedly arbitrary one four zero zero is used here overview style and trends the general trend in medieval music is toward complexity in harmony rhythm text and orchestration at the start of the era music is monophonic and homorhythmic with a unison sung text and no notated instrumental support the notation system is weak and rhythm cannot be specified the simplicity of chant with unison voice and natural declamation is most common polyphony and notation develop harmony in consonant intervals of fourths fifths and octaves begins to be seen rhythmic notation allows for complex interactions between multiple vocals lines in a repeatable fashion the use of multiple texts and instrumental accompaniment has developed by the end of the era instruments the instruments used to perform medieval music are largely still in existence in different forms however those instruments are less popular today the medieval cornett differed immensely from its modern day counterpart the trumpet cornetts in medieval times were quite short they were either straight or somewhat curved and construction became standardised on a curved version by approximately the middle one five th century in one side there would be several holes the flute was once made of wood rather than silver and could be made as a side blown or end blown instrument the recorder on the other hand has more or less retained its past form the gemshorn is similar to the recorder or ocarina one of the flute s predecessors the pan flute was popular in medieval times and is possibly of greek origin the pipes were made of wood and were graduated in length to produce different pitches many medieval strings were most alike to the modern day guitar such as the lute mandolin psaltery and zither the dulcimer similar in structure to the others was not plucked but hammered the hurdy gurdy was played with a resined wheel of wood attached to a handle as opposed to a modern day bow string instruments without sound boxes such as the harp and jew s harp were popular also early versions of the organ fiddle or vielle and trombone called the sackbut existed as well genres in this era music was both sacred and secular although almost no early secular music has survived and since notation was a relatively late development reconstruction of this music especially before the one two th century is currently subject to conjecture see authentic performance theory and notation in music theory the period saw several advances over previous practice mostly in conception and notation of rhythm the most famous music theorist of the first half of the one three th century johannes de garlandia was the author of the de mensurabili musica about one two four zero the treatise which defined and most completely elucidated the rhythmic modes a notational system for rhythm in which one of six possible patterns was denoted by a particular succession of note shapes organized in what is called a ligature to begin a line the line once it had its mode would remain in it until another ligature indicated a change a german theorist of a slightly later period franco of cologne was the first to describe a system of notation in which differently shaped notes have entirely different rhythmic values in the ars cantus mensurabilis of approximately one two six zero an innovation which had a massive impact on the subsequent history of european music most of the surviving notated music of the one three th century uses the rhythmic modes as defined by garlandia philippe de vitry is most famous in music history for writing the ars nova one three two two a treatise on music which gave its name to the music of the entire era his contributions to notation in particular notation of rhythm were particularly important and made possible the free and quite complex music of the next hundred years in some ways the modern system of rhythmic notation began with vitry who broke free from the older idea of the rhythmic modes patterns which were repeated without being individually notated the notational predecessors of modern time meters also originate in the ars nova for franco a breve for an brief explanation of the mensural notation in general see the article renaissance music had equalled three semibreves on occasion two locally and with certain context always however these two semibreves were one of normal length and one of double length thereby taking the same space of time and the same ternary division held for all larger and smaller note values by the time of ars nova the breve could be pre divided for an entire composition or section of one into groups of two or three smaller values by use of a mensuration sign equivalent to our modern time signature this way the tempus denoting the division of the breve which ultimately achieved the same primacy over rhythmic structure as our modern measure could be either perfect with the ternary division or imperfect with the binary perfect tempus was indicated by a circle for a signature while imperfect was denoted by a half circle our current c as a stand in for four four time is actually a holdover from this practice not an abbreviation for common time as popularly believed for the duration of the medieval period most music would be composed primarily in perfect tempus with special effects created by sections of imperfect tempus there is a great current controversy among musicologists as to whether such sections were performed with a breve of equal length or whether it changed and if so at what proportion in the highly syncopated works of the ars subtilior different voices of the same composition would sometimes be written in different tempus signatures simultaneously many scholars citing a lack of positive attributory evidence now consider vitry s treatise to be anonymous but this does not diminish its importance for the history of rhythmic notation the first definitely identifiable scholar to accept and explain the mensural system was johannes de muris jehan des mars who can be said to have done for it what garlandia did for the rhythmic modes for specific medieval music theorists see also isidore of seville aurelian of r me odo of cluny guido of arezzo hermannus contractus johannes cotto johannes afflighemensis

and philippe de vitry early medieval music one one five zero early chant traditions chant or plainsong is a monophonic sacred form which represents the earliest known music of the christian church the jewish synagogue tradition of singing psalms was a strong influence on christian chanting chant developed separately in several european centers the most important were rome spain gaul milan and ireland these chants were all developed to support the regional liturgies used when celebrating the mass there each area developed its own chants and rules for celebration in spain mozarabic chant was used and shows the influence of north african music the mozarabic liturgy even survived through muslim rule though this was an isolated strand and this music was later suppressed in an attempt to enforce conformity on the entire liturgy in milan ambrosian chant named after st ambrose was the standard celtic chant was used in ireland around one zero one one ad the catholic church wanted to standardize the mass and chant at this time rome was the religious center of europe and paris was the political center the standardization effort consisted mainly of combining these two roman and gallican regional liturgies this body of chant became known as gregorian chant gregorian chant a doctrinally unified version which came together from under the supervision of rome in approximately the ninth century was called gregorian chant a type of plainsong that was central to the musical tradition of europe in the medieval era the actual melodies that make up the repertory probably come from several sources some as far back as the pontificate of gregory the great himself c five nine zero six zero four many of them were probably written in the politically stable relatively literate setting of western monasteries during the reign of charlemagne the earliest surviving sources of chant showing musical notation are from the early ninth century though the consistency of the music across a wide area implies that some form of chant notation now lost may have existed earlier than this it should be noted that music notation existed in the ancient world for example greece but the ability to read and write this notation was lost around the fifth century as was all of the music that went with it to what extent the music of the gregorian chant represents a survival of the music of the ancient world is much debated by scholars but certainly there must have been some influence if only from the music of the synagogue only the smallest of scraps of ancient music have survived for instance the seikilos epitaph but those that have show a not surprising similarity of mode shape and phrase conception to later western music chant survived and prospered in monasteries and religious centers throughout the chaotic years of the early middle ages for these were the places of greatest stability and literacy most developments in western classical music are either related to or directly descended from procedures first seen in chant and its earliest elaborations early polyphony organum around the end of the ninth century singers in monasteries such as st gall in switzerland began experimenting with adding another part to the chant generally a voice in parallel motion singing in mostly perfect fourths or fifths with the original tune see interval this development is called organum and represents the beginnings of counterpoint over the next several centuries organum developed in several ways the most significant was the creation of florid organum around one one zero zero sometimes known as the school of st martial named after a monastery in south central france which contains the best preserved manuscript of this repertory in florid organum the original tune would be sung in long notes while an accompanying voice would sing many notes to each one of the original often in a highly elaborate fashion all the while emphasizing the perfect consonances fourths fifths and octaves as in the earlier organa later developments of organum occurred in england where the interval of the third was particularly favored and where organa were likely improvised against an existing chant melody and at notre dame in paris which was to be the center of musical creative activity throughout the thirteenth century much of the music from the early medieval period is anonymous some of the names may have been poets and lyric writers and the tunes for which they wrote words may have been composed by others attribution of monophonic music of the medieval period is not always reliable surviving manuscripts from this period include the musica enchiriadis codex calixtinus of santiago de compostela and the winchester troper for information about specific composers or poets writing during the early medieval period see pope gregory i st godric hildegard of bingen hucbald notker balbulus odo of arezzo odo of cluny and tutilo liturgical drama main article liturgical drama another musical tradition of europe originated during the early middle ages was the liturgical drama in its original form it may represent a survival of roman drama with christian stories mainly the gospel the passion and the lives of the saints grafted on every part of europe had some sort of tradition of musical or semi musical drama in the middle ages involving acting speaking singing and instrumental accompaniment in some combination probably these dramas were performed by traveling actors and musicians many have been preserved sufficiently to allow modern reconstruction and performance for example the play of daniel which has been recently recorded goliards the goliards were itinerant poet musicians of europe from the tenth to the middle of the thirteenth century most were scholars or ecclesiastics and they wrote and sang in latin although many of the poems have survived very little of the music has they were possibly influential even decisively so on the troubador trouv re tradition which was to follow most of their poetry is secular and while some of the songs celebrate religious ideals others are frankly profane dealing with drunkenness debauchery and lechery high medieval music one one five zero one three zero zero ars antiqua the flowering of the notre dame school of polyphony from around one one five zero to one two five zero corresponded to the equally impressive achievements in gothic architecture indeed the center of activity was at the cathedral of notre dame itself sometimes the music of this period is called the parisian school or parisian organum and represents the beginning of what is conventionally known as ars antiqua this was the period in which rhythmic notation first appeared in western music mainly a context based method of rhythmic notation known as the rhythmic modes this was also the period in which concepts of formal structure developed which were attentive to proportion texture and architectural effect composers of the period alternated florid and discant organum more note against note as opposed to the succession of many note melismas aginst long held notes found in the florid type and created several new musical forms clausulae which were melismatic sections of organa extracted and fitted with new words and further musical elaboration conductus which was a song for one or more voices to be sung rhythmically most likely in a procession of some sort and tropes which were rearrangements of older chants with new words and sometimes new music all of these genres save one were based upon chant that is one of the voices usually three though sometimes four nearly always the lowest the tenor at this point sung a chant melody though with freely composed note lengths over which the other voices sung organum the exception to this method was the conductus a two voice composition that was freely composed in its entirety the motet one of the most important musical forms of the high middle ages and renaissance developed initially during the notre dame period out of the clausula especially the form using multiple voices as elaborated by p rotin who paved the way for this particularly by replacing many of his predecessor as canon of the cathedral l onin s lengthy florid clasulae with substitutes in a discant style gradually there came to be entire books of these substitutes available to be fitted in and out of the various chants since in fact there were more than can possibly have been used in context it is probable that the clasulae came to be performed independently either in other parts of the mass or in private devotions the clasulae thus practiced became the motet when troped with non liturgical words and was further developed into a form of great elaboration sophistication and subtlety in the fourteenth century the period of ars nova surviving manuscripts from this era include the codex montpellier codex bamberg and the el codex musical de las huelgas composers of this time include l onin p rotin w de wycombe adam de st victor and petrus de cruce pierre de la croix petrus is credited with the innovation of writing more than three semibreves to fit the length of a breve coming before the innovation of imperfect tempus this practice innagurated the era of what are now called petronian motets these late one three th century works are in three sometimes even four parts and have multiple texts sung simultaneously these texts can be either sacred or secular in subject with latin and french mixed also the petronian motet is a highly complex genre given its mixture of several semibreve breves with rhythmic modes and sometime with increasing frequency substitution of secular songs for chant in the tenor indeed ever increasing rhythmic complexity would be a fundamental characteristic of the one four th century though music in france italy and england would take quite different paths during that time troubadors and trouv res the music of the troubadors and trouv res was a vernacular tradition of monophonic secular song probably accompanied by instruments sung by professional occasionally itinerant musicians who were as skilled as poets as they were singers and instrumentalists the language of the troubadors was occitan also known as the langue d oc or proven al the language of the trouv res was old french also known as langue d oil the period of the troubadors corresponded to the flowering of cultural life in provence which lasted through the twelfth century and into the first decade of the thirteenth typical subjects of troubador song were war chivalry and courtly love the period of the troubadors ended abruptly with the albigensian crusade the fierce campaign by pope innocent iii to eliminate the cathar heresy and appropriate the wealth of a defenseless people which effectively exterminated the entire civilization surviving troubadors went either to spain northern italy or northern france where the trouv re tradition lived on where their skills and techniques contributed to the later developments of secular musical culture in those places the music of the trouv res was similar to that of the troubadors but was able to survive into the thirteenth century unaffected by the war of extermination against the albigenses most of the more than two thousand surviving trouv re songs include music and show a sophistication as great as that of the poetry it accompanies the minnesinger tradition was the germanic counterpart to the activity of the troubadors and trouv res to the west unfortunately few sources survive from the time the sources of minnesang are mostly from two or three centuries after the peak of the movement leading to some controversy over their accuracy

composers of the middle and late medieval era late medieval music one three zero zero one four zero zero france ars nova the beginning of the ars nova is one of the few clean chronological divisions in medieval music since it corresponds to the publication of the roman de fauvel a huge compilation of poetry and music in one three one zero and one three one four the roman de fauvel is a satire on abuses in the medieval church and is filled with medieval motets lais rondeaux and other new secular forms while most of the music is anonymous it contains several pieces by philippe de vitry one of the first composers of the isorhythmic motet a development which distinguishes the fourteenth century the isorhythmic motet was perfected by guillaume de machaut the finest composer of the time during ars nova secular music acquired a polyphonic sophistication formerly found only in sacred music a development not surprising considering the secular character of the early renaissance and it should be noted that while this music is typically considered to be medieval the social forces that produced it were responsible for the beginning of the literary and artistic renaissance in italy the distinction between middle ages and renaissance is a blurry one especially considering arts as different as music and painting the term ars nova new art or new technique was coined by philippe de vitry in his treatise of that name probably written in one three two two in order to distinguish the practice from the music of the immediately preceding age the dominant secular genre of the ars nova was the chanson as it would continue to be in france for another two centuries these chansons were composed in musical forms corresponding to the poetry they set which were in the so called formes fixes rondeau ballade and virelai these forms significantly affected the development of musical structure in ways that are felt even today for example the ouvert clos rhyme scheme shared by all three demanded a musical realization which contributed directly to the modern notion of antecedent and consequent phrases it was in this period too in which began the long tradition of setting the mass ordinary this tradition started around mid century with isolated or paired settings of kyries glorias etc but machaut composed what is thought to be the first complete mass conceived as one composition the sound world of ars nova music is very much one of linear primacy and rhythmic complexity resting intervals are the fifth and octave with thirds and sixths considered dissonances leaps of more than a sixth in individual voices are not uncommon leading to speculation of instrumental participation at least in secular performance surviving french manuscripts include the ivrea codex and the apt codex for information about specific french composers writing in late medieval era see jehan de lescurel philippe de vitry guillaume de machaut borlet solage and fran ois andrieu italy trecento main article music of the trecento most of the music of ars nova was french in origin however the term is often loosely applied to all of the music of the fourteenth century especially to include the secular music in italy there this period was often referred to as trecento italian music has always it seems been known for its lyrical or melodic character and this goes back to the one four th century in many respects italian secular music of this time what little surviving liturgical music there is is similar to the french except for somewhat different notation featured what has been called the cantalina style with a florid top voice supported by two or even one a fair amount of italian trecento music is for only two voices that are more regular and slower moving this type of texture remained a feature of italian music in the popular one five th and one six th century secular genres as well and was an important influence on the eventual development of the trio texture that revolutionized music in the one seven th there were three main forms for secular works in the trecento one was the madrigal not the same as that of one five zero two five zero years hence but with a verse refrain like form three line stanzas each with different words alternated with a two line ritornello with the same text at each appearance perhaps we can see the seeds of the subsequent late renaissance and baroque ritornello in this device it too returns again and again recognizable each time in contrast with its surrounding disperate sections another form the caccia chase was written for two voices in a canon at the unison sometimes this form also featured a ritornello which were occasionally also in a cononic style usually the name of this genre provided a double meaning since the texts of caccia were primarily about hunts and related outdoor activities or at least action filled scenes the third main form was the ballata which was roughly equivalent to the french ballade surviving italian manuscripts include the squarcialupi codex and the rossi codex in all however significantly less italian music survives from the one four th century than french for information about specific italian composers writing in late medieval era see francesco landini gherardello da firenze andrea da firenze lorenzo da firenze paolo da firenze paolo tenorista giovanni da firenze aka giovanni da cascia bartolino da padova jacopo da bologna donato da cascia lorenzo masini niccol da perugia and maestro piero germany geisslerlieder the geisslerlieder were the songs of wandering bands of flagellants who sought to appease the wrath of an angry god by penitential music accompanied by mortification of their bodies there were two separate periods of activity of geisslerlied one around the middle of the thirteenth century from which unfortunately no music survives although numerous lyrics do and another from one three four nine for which both words and music survive intact due to the attention of a single priest who wrote about the movement and recorded its music this second period corresponds to the spread of the black death in europe and documents one of the most terrible events in european history both periods of geisslerlied activity were mainly in germany there was also french influenced polyphony written in german areas at this time but it was somewhat less sophisticated than its models in fairness to the mostly anonymous composers of this repertoire however most of the surviving manuscripts seem to have been copied with extreme incompetence and are filled with errors that make a truly thorough evaluation of the music s quality impossible mannerism and ars subtilior as often seen at the end of any musical era the end of the medieval era is marked by a highly manneristic style known as ars subtilior in some ways this was an attempt to meld the french and italian styles this music was highly stylized with a rhythmic complexity that was not matched until the two zero th century in fact not only was the rhythmic complexity of this repertoire largely unmatched for five and a half centuries with extreme syncopations mensural trickery and even examples of augenmusik such as a chanson by baude cordier written out in manuscript in the shape of a heart but also its melodic material was quite complex as well particularly in its interaction with the rhythmic structures already discussed under ars nova has been the practice of isorhythm which continued to develop through late century and in fact did not achieve its highest degree of sophistication until early in the one five th century instead of using isorhythmic techniques in one or two voices or trading them among voices some works came to feature a pervading isorhythmic texture which rivals the integral serialism of the two zero th century in its systematic ordering of rhythmic and tonal elements the term mannerism was applied by later scholars as it often is in response to an impression of sophistication being practiced for its own sake a malady which some authors have felt infected the ars subtillior for information about specific composers writing music in ars subtilior style see anthonello de caserta philippus de caserta aka philipoctus de caserta johannes ciconia matteo da perugia lorenzo da firenze grimace jacob senleches and baude cordier transitioning to the renaissance demarcating the end of the medieval era and the beginning of the renaissance with regards to the composition of music is problematic while the music of the fourteenth century is fairly obviously medieval in conception the music of the earlier fifteenth century is often conceived as belonging to a transitional period not only retaining some of the ideals of the end of the middle ages such as a type of polyphonic writing in which the parts differ widely from each other in character as each has its specific textural function but also showing some of the characteristic traits of the renaissance such as the international style developing through the diffusion of franco flemish musicians throughout europe and in terms of texture an increasing equality of parts the renaissance began early in italy but there musical innovation lagged far behind that of france and england the renaissance came late to england but there musical innovation was ahead of continental europe music historians do not agree on when the renaissance era began but most historians agree that england was still a medieval society in the early fifteenth century see a discussion of periodization issues of the middle ages while there is no consensus one four zero zero is a useful marker because it was around that time that the renaissance came into full swing in italy the increasing reliance on the interval of the third as a consonance is one of the most pronounced features of transition into the renaissance polyphony in use since the one two th century became increasingly elaborate with highly independent voices throughout the one four th century with john dunstable and other english composers partly through the local technique of faburden an improvisitory process in which a chant melody and a written part in parallel sixths below it are ornamented by one sung in perfect fourths below the former and which later took hold on the continent as fauxbordon the interval of the third emerges as an important musical development because of this english countenance which had been developing on the somewhat isolated island even during the ars subtillior their music is often regarded as the first to sound less truly bizarre to modern unschooled audiences english stylistic tendencies in this regard had come to fruition and begun to influence continental composers while the one zero zero years war continued english nobles armies their chapels and retinues and therefore some of their composers traveled in france and performed their music there it must also of course be remembered that the english controlled portions of northern france at this time anyhow as early as the one four two zero s and can be seen there in works of the young dufay among others english manuscripts include the worcester fragments the old st andrews music book the old hall manuscript and egerton manuscript for information about specific composers who are considered

electromagnetic waves through amplification due to stimulated emission historically the term came from the acronym m icrowave a mplification by s timulated e mission of r adiation although modern masers emit over a broad portion of the electromagnetic spectrum this has led some to replace m icrowave with m olecular in the acronym as suggested by townes when optical coherent oscillators were first developed they were called optical masers but it has become more common to refer to these as lasers see the section on terminology below for more on this history theoretically reflecting principles previously discussed by joseph weber at the june one nine five two conference of the institute of radio engineers the principle of the maser was described by nikolay basov and alexander prokhorov from lebedev institute of physics at an all union conference on radio spectroscopy held by ussr academy of sciences in may one nine five two they subsequently published their results in october one nine five four independently charles h townes j p gordon and h j zeiger built the first maser at columbia university in one nine five three the device used stimulated emission in a stream of energised ammonia molecules to produce amplification of microwaves at a frequency of two four gigahertz townes later worked with arthur l schawlow to describe the principle of the optical maser or laser which theodore h maiman first demonstrated in one nine six zero for their research in this field townes basov and prokhorov were awarded the nobel prize in physics in one nine six four technology the maser is based on the principle of stimulated emission proposed by albert einstein in one nine one seven when atoms have been put into an excited energy state they can amplify radiation at the proper frequency by putting such an amplifying medium in a resonant cavity feedback is created that can produce coherent radiation some common types of masers atomic beam masers ammonia maser hydrogen maser gas masers rubidium maser solid state masers ruby maser the dual noble gas maser is an example of a masing medium which is nonpolar uses masers serve as high precision frequency references these atomic frequency standards are one form of atomic clock they are also used as electronic amplifiers in radio telescopes hydrogen maser a hydrogen maser today the most important type of maser is the hydrogen maser which is currently used as an atomic frequency standard together with other types of atomic clocks they constitute the temps atomic international or tai this is the international time scale which is coordinated by the bureau international des poids et mesures or bipm it was norman ramsey and his colleagues who first realized this device today s masers are identical to the original design the maser oscillation relies on stimulated emission between two hyperfine levels of atomic hydrogen here is a brief description of how it works first a beam of atomic hydrogen is produced this is done by submitting the gas at low pressure to a rf discharge see the picture on this page the next step is state selection in order to get some stimulated emission it is necessary to create a population inversion of the atoms this is done in a way that is very similar to the famous stern gerlach experiment after passing through an aperture and a magnetic field many of the atoms in the beam are left in the upper energy level of the lasing transition from this state the atoms can decay to the lower state and emit some microwave radiation a high quality factor microwave cavity confines the microwaves and reinjects them repeatedly into the atom beam the stimulated emission amplifies the microwaves on each pass through the beam this combination of amplification and feedback is what defines all oscillators the resonant frequency of the microwave cavity is exactly tuned to the hyperfine structure of hydrogen one four two zero four zero five seven five one ghz a small fraction of the signal in the microwave cavity is coupled into a coaxial cable and then sent to a coherent receiver the microwave signal coming out of the maser is very weak a few pw and the frequency is extremely stable but can not be changed the coherent receiver is used to amplify the signal and change the frequency this is done using a series of phase locked loops and a high performance quartz oscillator astrophysical masers stimulated microwave and radio wave emission is observed in astronomy and this is usually called masing even in the absence of the resonant feedback that would be required for a true maser technically this form of stimulated emission is called superradiant emission and it is closely associated with lasing and masing such emission is observed from water h two o hydroxyl radicals oh methanol ch three oh formaldehyde ch two o and silicon monoxide sio maser like stimulated emission also occurs in nature in interstellar space water molecules in star forming regions can undergo a population inversion and emit radiation at two two ghz creating the brightest spectral line in the radio universe some water masers also emit radiation from a vibrational mode at nine six ghz terminology the meaning of the term maser has changed slightly since its introduction initially the acronym was universally given as m icrowave a mplification by s timulated e mission of r adiation which described devices which emitted in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum the principle of stimulated emission has since been extended to more devices and frequencies and so the original acronym is sometimes modified as suggested by charles h townes to m olecular a mplification by s timulated e mission of r adiation molecular is used here in the sense of kinetic theory where the base element of a kinetic system is a molecule even if it happens to be monatomic this should not be confused with the usage of the term in the molecular sciences where it refers to a bound state comprising two or more atoms initially visible light oscillators based on stimulated emission were called optical masers but this terminology has become uncommon it is more conventional now to refer to devices that emit in the x ray through infrared portions of the spectrum as lasers and devices that emit in the microwave region and below as masers there is some debate over whether maser or laser is the correct generic term for all devices that produce coherent electromagnetic waves through stimulated emission distinct names were originally proposed for devices that emit in each portion of the spectrum including grasers gamma ray lasers xasers x ray lasers uvasers ultraviolet lasers lasers visible lasers irasers infrared lasers masers microwave masers and rasers rf masers most of these terms never caught on however and all have now become obsolete except for maser and laser masers in science fiction masers often appear as weapons in science fiction movies and novels their characteristics often differ from those of real masers however and it is doubtful whether a practical maser weapon such as these can actually be made some notable science fiction appearances of masers masers are the most recognizable weapon in the godzilla series and toho s other monster movies maser tanks are often deployed against monsters these fire a bolt of electricity presumably created by amplified microwaves the maser tank is also present as a unit in outpost two it is one of the weaker units masers are used predominantly as weaponry both from spaceships and by ground troops in peter f hamilton s night s dawn universe as well as appearing in his commonwealth saga in the anime series gundam seed maser cannons are often equipped on amphibious mobile suits in lieu of beam weapons which function poorly underwater within the context of the series masers are described as sound waves focused in laser like fashion the chiss race in

see marcus antonius disambiguation bust of mark antony marcus antonius latin m antonivs m f m n ca eight three bc august three zero bc known in english as mark antony was a roman politician and general he was an important supporter of julius caesar as a military commander and administrator after caesar s assassination antony allied with octavian and marcus aemilius lepidus to form the second triumvirate the triumvirate broke up in three three bc and the disagreement turned to civil war in three one bc in which antony was defeated by octavian at the battle of actium and then at alexandria antony committed suicide along with his wife cleopatra in three zero bc early life anthony was born in rome around eight three bc his father was his namesake marcus antonius creticus the son of the great rhetorician marcus antonius orator executed by gaius marius supporters in eight six bc through his mother julia caesaris he was a distant cousin of julius caesar his father died at a young age leaving him and his brothers lucius and gaius to the care of his mother julia antonia known in sources by her married name to distinguish her from the other julias then married publius cornelius lentulus sura a politician involved in and executed durrring the catiline conspiracy of six three bc antony s early life was characterized by a lack of parental guidance according to historians like plutarch he spent his teenage years roaming through rome with his brothers and friends publius clodius pulcher among them probably out of hostility to cicero who had caused lentulus sura to be put to death as a catilinarian the connection was severed by a disagreement arising from his relations with clodius s wife fulvia together they embarked on a rather wild sort of life frequenting gambling houses drinking too much and involving themselves in scandalous love affairs plutarch mentions the rumour that before antony reached twenty years of age he was already indebted the sum of two five zero talents equivalent to several million dollars after this period of recklessness antony fled to greece to escape his creditors and to study rhetoric after a short time spent in attendance on the philosophers at athens he was summoned by aulus gabinius proconsul of syria to take part in the campaigns against aristobulus in judea and in support of ptolemy auletes in egypt in the ensuing campaign he demonstrated his talents as a cavalry commander and distinguished himself with bravery and courage it was during this campaign that he first visited egypt and alexandria supporter of caesar in five four bc antony became a member of the staff of caesar s armies in gaul he again proved to be a competent military leader in the gallic wars but his personality caused instability wherever he went caesar himself was said to be frequently irritated by his behaviour nevertheless raised by caesar s influence to the offices of quaestor augur and tribune of the plebs five zero bc he supported the cause of his patron with great energy caesar s two proconsular commands during a period of ten years were expiring and the general wanted to return to rome for the consular elections but resistance from the conservative faction of the roman senate led by pompey demanded that caesar resign his proconsulship and the command of his armies before being allowed to seek re election to the consulship this he could not do as such an act would leave him a private citizen and therefore open to prosecution for his acts while proconsul in the interim between his proconsulship and his second consulship it would also leave him at the mercy of pompey s armies antony proposed that both generals lay down their commands the idea was rejected and antony resorted to violence ending up expelled from the senate he left rome joining caesar who had led his armies to the banks of the rubicon the river that marked the southern limit of his proconsular authority with all hopes of a peaceful solution for the conflict with pompey gone caesar led his armies across the river into italy and marched on rome starting the last republican civil war during the civil war antony was caesar s second in command in all battles against the pompeians antony led the left wing of the army a proof of caesar s confidence in him when caesar became dictator antony was made master of the horse the dictator s right hand man and in this capacity remained in italy as the peninsula s administrator in four seven bc while caesar was fighting the last pompeians who had taken refuge in the african provinces but antony s skills as administrator were a poor match to those as general and he seized the opportunity of indulging in the most extravagant excesses depicted by cicero in the philippics in four six bc he seems to have taken offence because caesar insisted on payment for the property of pompey which antony professedly had purchased but had in fact simply appropriated conflict soon arose and as on other occasions antony resorted to violence hundreds of citizens were killed and rome herself descended into a state of anarchy caesar was most displeased with the whole affair and removed antony from all political responsibilities the two men did not see each other for two years the estrangement was not of long continuance for we find antony meeting the dictator at narbo four five bc and rejecting the suggestion of trebonius that he should join in the conspiracy that was already on foot reconciliation arrived in four four bc when antony was chosen as partner for caesar s fifth consulship whatever conflicts existed between the two men antony remained faithful to caesar at all times in february of four four bc during the lupercalia festival february one five antony publicly offered caesar a diadem this was an event fraught with meaning a diadem was a symbol of a king and in refusing it caesar demonstrated that he did not intend to assume the throne on march one five four four bc the ides of march julius caesar was assassinated by a group of senators led by gaius cassius longinus and marcus junius brutus in the turmoil that surrounded the event antony escaped rome dressed as a slave fearing that the dictator s assassination would be the start of a bloodbath among his supporters when this did not occur he soon returned to rome discussing a truce with the assassins faction for a while antony as consul of the year seemed to pursue peace and the end of the political tension following a speech by marcus tullius cicero in the senate an amnesty was agreed for the assassins then came the day of caesar s funeral as caesar s ever present second in command partner in consulship and cousin antony was the natural choice to make the funeral eulogy in his speech he sprang his accusations of murder and ensured a permanent breach with the conspirators showing a talent for rhetoric and dramatic interpretation antony snatched the toga from caesar s body to show the crowd the scars from his wounds that night the roman populace attacked the assassins houses forcing them to flee for their lives antony surrounded himself with a bodyguard of caesar s veterans and forced the senate to transfer to him the province of cisalpine gaul which was then administered by decimus junius brutus one of the conspirators brutus refused to surrender the province and antony set out to attack him in october four four bc the second triumvirate denarius minted by mark antony to pay his legions on the reverse the standard of his third legion the death of caesar had left an open space in rome s politics the republic was dying and yet another civil war was starting it was then that octavian caesar s great nephew and adopted son arrived from illyria and claimed the inheritance of his father octavian obtained the support of the senate and of cicero and the veteran troops of the dictator flocked to his standard he was also very willing to fight for power with the other two main contestants antony himself and lepidus antony was denounced as a public enemy and octavian was entrusted with the command of the war against him antony was defeated at mutina four three bc where he was besieging brutus the consuls aulus hirtius and c vibius pansa however fell in the battle and the senate became suspicious of octavian who irritated at the refusal of a triumph and the appointment of brutus to the command over his head entered rome at the head of his troops and forced the senate to bestow the consulship upon him august one nine meanwhile antony escaped to cisalpine gaul effected a junction with lepidus and marched towards rome with a large force of infantry and cavalry octavian betrayed his party and came to terms with antony and lepidus the three leaders met at bononia and adopted the title of triumviri reipublicae constituendae as joint rulers gaul was to belong to antony hispania to lepidus and africa sardinia and sicily to octavian the triumvirs for the organization of the people gained official recognition by the lex titia a law passed by the assembly in four three bc which granted them virtually all powers for a period of five years to solidify the alliance octavian married clodia pulchra antony s step daughter the triumvirs then set to pursue the assassins faction who had fled to the east and to murder the conspirators supporters who remained in rome a reign of terror followed proscriptions confiscations and executions became general some of the noblest citizens were put to death cicero was the most famous victim of these violent days having been executed during his attempt to flee according to anthony everitt s recent biography antony and his wife fulvia did not spare the body cicero s head and hands were posted in the rostra with his tongue pierced by fulvia s golden hairpins after the twin battles at philippi and the suicides of brutus and cassius the senatorial and republican parties had been annihilated no one else would defy the triumvirate s power with the political and military situations resolved the triumvirs divided the roman world among themselves lepidus took control of the western provinces and octavian remained in italy with the responsibility of securing lands for the veteran soldiers an important task since the loyalty of the legions depended heavily on this promise as for antony he went to the eastern provinces to pacify yet another rebellion in judaea and attempt to conquer the parthian empire during this trip he met queen cleopatra vii of egypt in tarsus in four one bc and became her lover spending the winter in her company at alexandria meanwhile in italy the situation was not pacified octavian s administration was not appeasing and a revolt was about to occur moreover he divorced clodia giving a curious explanation she was annoying the leader of this revolt was fulvia the wife of antony a woman known to history for her political ambition and tempestuous character she feared for her husband s political position and was not keen to see her daughter put aside assisted by lucius antonius her brother in law fulvia raised eight legions with her own money her army invaded rome and for a while managed to create problems for octavian however in the winter of four one four zero bc fulvia was besieged in perusia and forced to surrender by starvation fulvia was exiled to sicyon where she died while waiting for antony s arrival fulvia s death was providential a reconciliation was effected between the triumvirs and cemented by the marriage of antony with octavia in october four zero bc octavian s beloved sister a new division of the roman world was made lepidus receiving africa octavian the west and antony the east this peace known as the treaty of brundisium reinforced the triumvirate and allowed antony to finally prepare his long awaited campaign against the parthians antony and cleopatra with this military purpose on his mind antony sailed to greece with his new wife where he behaved in a most extravagant manner assuming the attributes of the god dionysus three nine bc but the rebellion in sicily of sextus pompeius the last of the pompeians kept the army promised to antony in italy with his plans again severed antony and octavian quarreled again this time with the help of octavia a new treaty was signed in tarentum in three eight bc the triumvirate was renewed for a period of another five years ending in three three bc and octavian promised again to send legions to the east but by now antony was skeptical of octavian s true support of his parthian cause leaving octavia pregnant of her second antonia in rome he sailed to alexandria where he expected funding from cleopatra the mother of his twins the queen of egypt loaned him the money he needed for the army but the campaign proved a disaster after a series of defeats in battle antony lost most of his egyptian army during a retreat through armenia in the peak of winter meanwhile in rome the triumvirate was no more lepidus was forced to resign after an ill judged political move now in sole power octavian was occupied in wooing the traditional republican aristocracy to his side he married livia and started to attack antony in order to raise himself to power he argued that antony was a man of low morals to have left his faithful wife abandoned in rome with the children to be with the promiscuous queen of egypt antony was accused of everything but most of all of becoming native an unforgivable crime to the proud romans several times antony was summoned to rome but remained in alexandria with cleopatra again with egyptian money antony invaded armenia this time successfully in the return a mock roman triumph was celebrated in the streets of alexandria the parade through the city was a pastiche of rome s most important military celebration for the finale the whole city was summoned to hear a very important political statement surrounded by cleopatra and her children antony was about to put an end to his alliance with octavian he distributed kingdoms between his children alexander helios was named king of armenia and parthia not conquered yet his twin cleopatra selene got cyrenaica and libya and the young ptolemy philadelphus was awarded syria and cilicia as for cleopatra she was proclaimed queen of kings and queen of egypt to rule with caesarion ptolemy caesar son of julius caesar king of kings and king of egypt most important of all caesarion was declared legitimate son and heir of julius caesar these proclamations were known as the donations of alexandria and caused a fatal breach in antony s relations with rome distributing insignificant lands among the children of cleopatra was not a peace move but it was not a serious problem either what did seriously threaten octavian s political position however was the acknowledgement of caesarion as legitimate and heir to julius caesar s name octavian s base of power was his link with caesar through adoption which granted him much needed popularity and loyalty of the legions to see this convenient situation attacked by a child sired by the richest woman in the world was something octavian could not accept the triumvirate expired on the last day of three three bc and was not renewed another civil war was beginning during three three and three two bc a propaganda war was fought in the political arena of rome with accusations flying between sides antony in egypt divorced octavia and accused octavian of being a social upstart of usurping power and of forging the adoption papers by julius caesar octavian responded with treason charges of illegally keeping provinces that should be given to other men by lots as was rome s tradition and of starting wars against foreign nations armenia and parthia without the consent of the senate antony was also held responsible for sextus pompeius execution with no trial in three two bc the senate deprived him of his powers and declared war against cleopatra both consuls gnaeus domitius ahenobarbus and gaius sosius and a third of the senate abandoned rome to meet antony and cleopatra in greece in three one bc the war started octavian s loyal and talented general marcus agrippa captured the greek city and naval port of methone loyal to antony the enormous popularity of octavian with the legions secured the defection of the provinces of cyrenaica and greece to his side on september two the naval battle of actium took place antony and cleopatra s navy was destroyed and they were forced to escape to egypt with sixty ships octavian now close to absolute power did not intend to give them rest in august three zero bc assisted by agrippa he invaded egypt with no other refuge to escape to antony committed suicide in the mistaken belief that cleopatra had already done so three zero bc a few days later cleopatra herself followed his example antony had been married in succession to fadia antonia fulvia and octavia and left behind him a number of children aftermath and legacy with the death of antony octavian became uncontested ruler of rome no one else attempted to take power from him in the following years octavian known as augustus caesar after two seven bc managed to accumulate in his person all administrative political and military offices when augustus died in ad one four his political powers passed to his adopted son tiberius the roman principate had begun the rise of caesar and the subsequent civil war between his two most powerful adherents effectively ended the credibility of the roman oligarchy as a governing power and ensured that all future power struggles would centre upon which of two or more individuals would achieve supreme control of the government rather than upon an individual in conflict with the senate thus antony as caesar s key adherent and one of the two men around whom power coalesced following his assassination was one of the three men chiefly responsible for the fall of the roman republic antony s marriages and descendants marriage to fadia marriage to antonia hybrida his direct cousin according to plutarch antony threw his cousin out of his roman house because she slept with his friend the tribune dolabella however it is not known whether they divorced or she died before antony married fulvia marriage to fulvia marcus antonius antyllus executed by octavian in three one bc iullus antonius married claudia marcella major daughter of octavia marriage to octavia antonia major married lucius domitius ahenobarbus antonia minor

with their new name they won the league in one nine zero eight and the fa cup on april two six one nine zero nine against bristol city at crystal palace then with financial assistance from davies united moved from bank street to a new stadium at old trafford in one nine one zero they won the championship for the second time in one nine one one the busby years one nine four five one nine six nine matt busby was appointed manager in one nine four five and took a then unheard of approach to his job joining the players for training as well as performing administrative tasks he was immediately successful with the club finishing second in the league in one nine four seven and winning the fa cup in one nine four eight he adopted a policy of bringing in players from the youth team whenever possible and the team won the league in one nine five six with an average age of only two two the following season they won the league again and reached the fa cup final losing to aston villa they also became the first english team to compete in the european cup and reached the semi final tragedy struck the following season when the plane carrying the team home from a european cup match crashed on take off at a refuelling stop in munich the munich air disaster of six february one nine five eight claimed the lives of eight players and another fifteen passengers there was talk of the club folding but with jimmy murphy taking over as manager while matt busby recovered from his injuries the club continued playing with a makeshift side they somehow reached the fa cup final again where they lost to bolton busby rebuilt the team throughout the early one nine six zero s signing players such as denis law and pat crerand the team won the fa cup in one nine six three then won the

nine eight six manchester united f c badge in the one nine seven zero s united struggled to replace busby and the team struggled under wilf mcguinness and frank o farrell before tommy docherty became manager at the end of one nine seven two docherty or the doc saved united from relegation that season but united were relegated in one nine seven four the team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the fa cup final in one nine seven six but were beaten by southampton they reached the final again in one nine seven seven beating liverpool and preventing their opponents from completing the first ever treble which united would go on to win in one nine nine nine in spite of this success and his popularity with the supporters docherty was sacked soon after the final when he was found to have had an affair with the physiotherapist s wife dave sexton replaced docherty as manager in the summer of one nine seven seven and made the team play in a more defensive formation this style was unpopular with supporters who were used to the attacking football preferred by docherty and busby and after failing to win a trophy sexton was sacked in one nine eight one he was replaced by the flamboyant ron atkinson who immediately broke the british record transfer fee to sign bryan robson from west brom atkinson s team featured new signings such as jesper olsen and gordon strachan playing alongside the former youth team players norman whiteside and mark hughes united won the fa cup in one nine eight three and one nine eight five and were overwhelming favourites to win the league in the one nine eight five eight six season after winning their first ten league games opening a ten point gap over their rivals as early as october the team s form collapsed however and united finished the season in fourth place the poor form continued into the following season and with united on the edge of the first division s relegation zone atkinson was sacked the alex ferguson era pre treble one nine eight six one nine nine eight alex ferguson replaced atkinson and guided the club to an one one th place finish the following season one nine eight seven eight eight united finished second with brian mcclair becoming the first united player since george best to score twenty league goals in a season however united struggled badly throughout one nine eight nine with many of ferguson s signings not reaching the expectations of the fans there was speculation that ferguson would be sacked at the beginning of one nine nine zero but a win in the third round of the fa cup over nottingham forest kept the season alive and united went on to win the competition beating crystal palace on a replay in the final united won the european cup winners cup in one nine nine zero nine one beating that season s spanish champions barcelona in the final but the following season was a disappointment for united as a late season slump saw them miss out on the league to rivals leeds united meanwhile in one nine nine one the club had floated on the london stock exchange with a valuation of one eight million thus bringing its finances into the public eye as never before the arrival of eric cantona in november one nine nine two provided the crucial spark for united and they finished the one nine nine two nine three season as champions for the first time since one nine six seven they won the double the league and the fa cup for the first time the following season but legendary manager and club president matt busby died that year on two zero january one nine nine four cantona assaults spectator matthew simmons in one nine nine four nine five cantona received an eight month suspension for jumping into the crowd and assulting crystal palace supporter matthew simmons in united s game at selhurst park drawing their last league match and losing to everton in the fa cup final left united as runners up in both the league and fa cup ferguson then outraged the supporters by selling key players and replacing them with players from the club s youth team including david beckham and paul scholes the new players several of whom quickly became regular internationals did surprisingly well and united won the double again in one nine nine five nine six they won the league in one nine nine seven and eric cantona announced his retirement from football at the age of three zero several years earlier than most players they started the following season one nine nine seven nine eight well but their results were affected by a series of injuries and they finished the season in second place behind the double winning champions arsenal the treble one nine nine eight nine nine one nine nine eight nine nine was the most successful season in any english club s history as united became the first english team to win the treble uefa champions league premier league and fa cup in the same season in the final match of that season they defeated bayern munich in the champions league final two one scoring two late goals in injury time ferguson was knighted for his contributions to british football as a result after the treble one nine nine nine present united won the league by record margins in two zero zero zero and two zero zero one but the press saw these seasons as failures as they failed to regain the european cup ferguson adopted more defensive tactics to make united harder to beat in europe but it was not a success and united finished the season in third place in two zero zero two they regained the league the following season two zero zero two zero three and started the following season well but their form dropped significantly when rio ferdinand received an eight month suspension for missing a drugs test they did win the two zero zero four f a cup however knocking out arsenal that season s eventual champions on their way to the final the two zero zero four zero five season was characterised by a failure to score goals mainly due to the injury of striker ruud van nistelrooy and united finished the season trophyless and in third place in the league this time even the consolation prize of the f a cup eluded them although they completely outplayed arsenal and had a rio ferdinand goal disallowed in one of the most one sided finals ever seen and were beaten on penalties off the pitch the main story was the possibility of the club being taken over and at the end of the season tampa businessman malcolm glazer acquired a controlling interest in the club united made a poor start to the two zero zero five zero six season with team captain roy keane leaving the club to join his boyhood heroes celtic after publicly criticising several of his teammates and the club failed to qualify for the knock out phase of the uefa champions league for the first time in over a decade however they prevented from getting nothing in second successive seasons by winning two zero zero six league cup the malcolm glazer takeover on may one three two zero zero five businessman malcolm glazer acquired a controlling interest in the club in a takeover valuing it at approximately eight zero zero million one four seven billion on may one six he increased his share to the seven five necessary to delist the club from the stock exchange taking it private again and announced his intention to do so within two zero days on seven june he appointed his sons joel avram and bryan to the p l c board of manchester united with joel avram and bryan as non executive directors it was expected that joel would be installed as the new chairman however that didn t come about and manchester united currently do not have a chairman at the same time sir roy gardner resigned his position as chairman of the p l c board along with non executive directors jim o neill and ian much who also resigned malcolm glazer also re appointed andy anson as commercial director after voting him off the board at the previous agm he also retained chief executive david gill and finance director nick humby in their current positions just to avoid any confusion manchester united football club are now a private comapany however they still have a p l c board as well as a football board support before the second world war few english football supporters travelled to away games because of the time and cost as united and city played home matches on alternate saturdays many mancunians would watch united one week and city the next after the war a stronger rivalry developed and it became more common for a supporter to choose one team to follow exclusively when united won the league in one nine five six they had the highest average home attendance in the league a record that had been held by newcastle for the previous few years following the munich air disaster in one nine five eight more people from outside manchester began to support united and as travel became quicker and cheaper many started to go to matches this swelled united s support and is one reason why united have had the highest league attendances in english football for almost every season since then even as a second division side in one nine seven four seven five a two zero zero two report do you come from manchester indicate that manchester city have a higher proportion of season ticket holders living in the manchester area although they sold fewer season tickets overall the club estimates they have six seven five million fans around the world with eight zero million fans in asia alone in the late one nine nine zero s and early part of the two zero zero zero s an increasing source of concern for many united supporters was the possibility of the club being taken over the supporters group imusa independent manchester united supporters association were extremely active in opposing a proposed takeover by rupert murdoch in one nine nine nine another pressure group shareholders united against murdoch which became shareholders united and is now the manchester united supporters trust was formed at around this time to encourage supporters to buy shares in the club partly to enable supporters to have a greater say in the issues that concern them such as ticket prices and allocation and partly to reduce the risk of an unwanted party buying enough shares to take over the club however this scheme failed to prevent malcolm glazer from becoming the majority shareholder in the club many supporters were outraged and some formed a new club called f c united of manchester the new club plays in the north west counties league second division and attracts an average attendance of almost three zero zero zero although the full effects of glazer s takeover on the club s support are not yet known the club has claimed a record number of season ticket sales however given the many empty

one four clubs mesa is a programming language developed at xerox parc that was used to program the xerox alto one of the first personal computers with a graphical user interface and later the xerox star workstations and later the globalview desktop environment the name mesa was chosen as a pun to signify that it is a high level programming language due to these historic links trained mesa programmers from xerox were well versed in the fundementals of guis networked environments and the other advances that xerox contributed to the field of computer science mesa is an algol like language it was designed around the concept of modular programming which stressed the separation between the programmer s interface of a library module and its implementation it was well beyond its time supporting concepts like incremental compilation and being used in environments that enabled the source code of a properly built application to be assembled from anywhere in the xerox intranet this way any mesa developer could debug any problems in the operating systems on xerox eight zero one zero and six zero eight five machines which were also coded in mesa before that time mesa was run on xerox s own stack based workstations such as the alto the eight zero one zero dandelion and the smaller and faster six zero eight five daybreak a secondary operating system called the xerox development environment xde allowed developers to debug the viewpoint gui operating system by swapping worlds therefore allowing crashes that would have paralysed the whole system to be debugged mesa was taught via the mesa programming course that took people through the wide range of technology that xerox had available at the time and that finished off with the programmer writing a hack a workable programme designed to be useful an actual example of such a hack is the bwsmagnifier which was written in one nine eight eight and allowed people to magnify sections of the workstation screen as defined by a resizable window and a changeable magnification factor descendants mesa was the precursor to the later language cedar when the u s dept of defense approached xerox to use mesa for its ironman programming language xerox management turned them down flatly us dod instead created the ada programming language as viewpoint desktop became globalview and was ported to various unix

during the sessions at florence of the council of siena in one four three nine during the failed attempts to heal the schism of the latin and greek churches cosimo de medici and his intellectual circle had made acquaintance with the neoplatonic philosopher george gemistos plethon whose discourses upon plato and the alexandrian mystics so fascinated the learned society of florence that they named him the second plato in one four five nine john argyropoulos was lecturing on greek language and literature at florence and marsilio became his pupil when cosimo decided to refound plato s academy at florence his choice to head it was marsilio who made the classic translation of plato from greek to latin published in one four eight two as well as a translation of a collection of hellenistic greek documents of the hermetic corpus yates one nine six four and the writings of many of the neoplatonists for example porphyry iamblichus plotinus et al following suggestions laid out

four three three births one four nine nine deaths christian philosophers italian philosophers neoplatonists astrologers pederastic lovers morphogenesis from the greek morph shape and genesis creation is one of three fundamental aspects of developmental biology along with the control of cell growth and cellular differentiation morphogenesis is concerned with the shapes of tissues organs and entire organisms and the positions of the various specialized cell types cell growth and differentiation can take place in cell culture or inside of tumor cell masses without the normal morphogenesis that is seen in an intact organism the study of morphogenesis involves an attempt to understand the processes that control the organized spatial distribution of cells that arises during the embryonic development of an organism and which give rise to the characteristic forms of tissues organs and overall body anatomy in the human embryo the change from a cluster of nearly identical cells at the blastula stage to a post gastrulation embryo with structured tissues and organs is controlled by the genetic program and can be modified by environmental factors some of the earliest ideas on how physical and mathematical processes and constraints affect biological growth were written by d arcy wentworth thompson and alan turing these works postulated the presence of chemical signals and physico chemical processes such as diffusion activation and deactivation in cellular and organismic growth the fuller understanding of the mechanisms involved in actual organisms required the discovery of dna and the development of molecular biology and biochemistry several types of molecules are particularly important during morphogenesis morphogens are soluble molecules that can diffuse and carry signals that control cell differentiation decisions in a concentration dependent fashion morphogens typically act through binding to specific protein receptors an important class of molecules involved in morphogenesis are transcription factor proteins that determine the fate of cells by interacting with dna these can be coded for by master regulatory genes and either activate or deactivate the transcription of other genes and in turn these secondary gene products can regulate the expression of still other genes in a regulatory cascade another class of molecules involved in morphogenesis are molecules that control cell adhesion for example during gastrulation clumps of stem cells switch off their cell to cell adhesion become migratory and take up new positions with an embryo where they again activate specific cell adhesion proteins and form new tissues and organs several examples that illustrate the roles of morphogens transcription factors and cell adhesion molecules in morphogenesis are discussed below anterior posterior axis patterning in drosophila one of the best understood morphogenetic systems is the patterning along the future head to tail antero posterior axis of the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster the development of drosophila is particularly well studied and it is representative of one major class of insects called insecta other multicellular organisms sometimes use similar mechanisms for axis formation although the relative importance of signal transfer between the earliest cells of many developing organisms is greater than in the example described here maternal effect genes mrna distributions mrna distributions the building blocks of anterior posterior axis patterning in drosophila are laid out during egg formation oogenesis well before the egg is fertilized and deposited the developing egg oozyte is polarized by differentially localized mrna molecules the genes that code for these mrnas called maternal effect genes encode for proteins that get translated upon fertilization to establish concentration gradients that span the egg bicoid and hunchback are the maternal effect genes that are most important for patterning of anterior parts head and thorax of the drosophila embryo nanos and caudal are maternal effect genes that are important in the formation of more posterior abdominal segments of the drosophila embryo cytoskeletal elements such as microtubules are polarized within the oocyte and can be used to allow the localization of mrna molecules to specific parts of the cell maternally synthesized bicoid mrnas attach to microtubules and are concentrated at the anterior ends of forming drosophila eggs nanos mrnas also attach to the egg cytoskeleton but they concentrate at the posterior ends of the eggs hunchback and caudal mrnas lack special location control systems and are fairly evenly spread throughout the interior of egg cells when the mrnas from the maternal effect genes are translated into proteins a bicoid protein gradient forms at the anterior end of the egg nanos protein forms a gradient at the posterior end the bicoid protein blocks translation of caudal mrna so caudal protein is made only in the posterior part the cell nanos protein binds to the hunchback mrna and blocks its translation in the posterior end of drosophila embryos the bicoid hunchback and caudal proteins are transcription factors bicoid has a dna binding homeodomain that binds both dna and the nanos mrna bicoid binds a specific rna sequence in the three untranslated region of caudal mrna and blocks translation hunchback protein levels in the early embryo are significantly augmented by new hunchback gene transcription and translation of the resulting zygotically produced mrna during early drosophila embryogenesis there are nuclear divisions without cell division the many nuclei that are produced distribute themselves around the periphery of the cell cytoplasm gene expression in these nuclei is regulated by the bicoid hunchback and caudal proteins for example bicoid acts as a transcriptional activator of hunchback gene transcription bicoid gradient nanos gradient gap genes gap genes the other important function of the gradients of bicoid hunchback and caudal proteins is in the transcriptional regulation of other zygotically expressed proteins many of these are the protein products derived from members of the gap family of developmental control genes hunchback kr ppel giant tailless and knirps are all gap genes their expression patterns in the early embryo are determined by the maternal effect gene products and shown in the diagrams on the right side of this page the gap genes are part of a larger family called the segmentation genes these genes establish the segmented body plan of the embryo along the anterior posterior axis the segmentation genes specify one four parasegments that are closely related to the final anatomical segments the gap genes are the first layer of a hierarchical cascade of the segmentation control genes proteins such as bicoid can be described as morphogens that act within the syncytial blastoderm of the early drosophila embryo these intracellular morphogens enter the nuclei and act as transcription factors to control expression of the gap genes in the blastoderm stage of drosophila morphogenesis four types of nuclear specification can be distinguished anterior head and thorax posterior abdomen dorso ventral terminal special structures at the unsegmented ends of the embryo additional segmentation genes pair rule two additional classes of segmentation genes are expressed after the gap gene products the pair rule genes are expressed in striped patterns of seven bands perpendicular to the anterior posterior axis see the example even skipped these patterns of expression are established within the syncytial blastoderm after these initial patterning events cell membranes form around the nuclei of the syncytial blastoderm converting it to a cellular blastoderm wingless morphogen the expression patterns of the final class of segmentation genes the segment polarity genes are then fine tuned by interactions between the cells of adjacent parasegments see the example engrailed to the right the engrailed protein is a transcription factor yellow in figure to left that is expressed in one row of cells at the edge of each parasegment this expression pattern is initiated by the pair rule genes like even skipped that code for transcription factors that regulate the engrailed gene s transcription in the syncytial blastoderm cells that make engrailed can make the cell to cell signaling protein hedgehog green in the figure to the left hedgehog is not free to move very far and activates a thin stripe of cells adjacent to the engrailed expressing cells only cells to one side of the engrailed expressing cells are competent to respond to hedgehog because they express the receptor protein patched blue in figure to left cells with activated patch receptor make the wingless protein red in the figure wingless protein acts as an extracelluar morphogen and patterns the adjacent rows of cells by activated its cell surface receptor frizzled in a concentration dependent fashion wingless also acts on engrailed expressing cells to stabilize engrailed expression after the cellular blastoderm forms the reciprocal signaling by hedgehog and wingless stabilizes the boundary between each segment the wingless protein is called wingless because of the phenotype of some wingless mutants wingless also functioned during metamorphosis to coordinate wing formation the transcription factors that are coded for by segmentation genes regulate yet another family of developmental control genes the homeotic selector genes these genes exist in two ordered groups on drosophila chromosome three the order of the genes on the chromosome reflects the order that they are expressed along the anterior posterior axis of the developing embryo the antennapedia group of homeotic selector genes includes labial antennapedia sex combs reduced deformed and proboscipedia labial and deformed proteins are expressed in head segments where they activate the genes that define head features sex combs reduced and antennapedia specify the properties of thoracic segments the bithorax group of homeotic selector genes control the specializations of the third thoracic segment and the abdominal segments in one nine nine five the nobel prize for physiology or medicine was awarded for studies concerning the genetic control of early embryonic development to christiane n sslein volhard edward b lewis and eric wieschaus their researches on genetic screening for embryo patterning mutants revealed the role played in early embryologic development by hox genes like bicoid an example of a homeotic mutation is the so called antennapedia mutation in drosophila antennae and legs are created by the same basic program they only differ in a single transcription factor if this transcription factor is damaged the fly grows legs on its head instead of antennae see images of this antennapedia mutant and others at flybase the term morphogenesis can also be used to describe the development of unicellular life forms that do not have an embryonic stage in their life cycle or to refer to the evolution of a body structure within a taxonomic group morphogenetic responses may be induced in organisms by hormones or by environmental chemicals ranging from substances produced by other organisms to toxic chemicals or radionuclides released as pollutants see also embryogenesis embryo model organism drosophila embryogenesis tagmosis developmental biology medium may mean

the midi interface to allow musical data files to be shared among various electronic instruments by using a standard list of commands and parameters known as general midi gm because the music is simply data and not actually recorded wave forms the data is essentially a series of on and off commands along with numerical information it is therefore maintained in a small file format several computer programs allow manipulation of the data so that composing for an entire orchestra is possible and can be reproduced by any electronic instrument that adheres to the gm standards there are many websites that allow downloads of popular songs as well as classical music along with the standard midi format a popular variation is the kar format a standard gm midi file with embedded song lyrics which when played back using a compatible pc karaoke player display the lyrics karaoke style while playing the song although the midi karaoke format precludes the use of background vocals and harmonies the incredibly small size of the file in comparison to other digital music formats the ease with which the files may be modified and edited and the ever increasing quality of midi

was an arab theologian born in the najd in present day saudi arabia and the most famous scholar of the movement within islam known as the wahhabi movement legacy he considered this movement an effort to purify islam by returning all muslims to what he believed were the original principles of islam as typified by the as salaf as saliheen the earliest converts to islam and rejected what he regarded as corruptions introduced by bida innovation reformation and shirk idolatry specifically during his time he denounced various sects of sufism he is considered by some to be a great reformer of islam while others regard him as the father of islamic terrorism some consider his ideas irrational and unoriginal merely reintepreting discredited interpretations of the qu ran while advocating a society mirroring that of arabia during the first century after the hijra they argue that his teachings are little more than the primitive intolerant views of a fanatic running counter to the rich body of historical islamic thought others believe he was an innovative and learned scholar whose revival of the hanbali school of jurisprudence has served the umma at large he has had a tremendous impact on modern islam particularly affecting muslim attitudes toward non muslims a number of leading figures in recent islamic terrorism such as osama bin laden ayman al zawahiri and abu musab al zarqawi have been influenced by his teachings and inspired by his movement abu musab al zarqawi has quoted muhammad ibn abd al wahhab in various occasions in statements he made especially the infamous statement that urged his followers to kill shia of iraq for their religious affiliation see historical shi a sunni relations al wahhab revived interest in the works of the islamic scholar ibn taymiya the followers of this revival see islamism are often called wahhabis but they reject the usage of this term on the grounds that al wahhab s teachings were the teachings of the prophet muhammed not his own thus they refer to themselves as salafists or muwahhidun meaning the monotheists biography childhood the early life of muhammed ibn abd al wahhab remains fairly uncertain despite the existence several studies on the subject historians at the time had no interest in the life of an obscure young scholar and most of the contemporary journals do not cover it thus there are only two official histories of ibn abd al wahhab and his religious movement ibn ghannam s tarikh najd and ibn bishr s unwan al majd fi tarikh najd three points should be taken into account regarding these sources for the early life of ibn abd al wahhab first they rarely mention specific dates of events secondly both authors were wahhabis themselves and therefore had a political and religious agenda to consider finally each was written after the death of ibn abd al wahhab birth of wahhabi movement in the year one seven four four ibn abd al wahhab began to attract followers in the small town al uyayna within the najd region the central region of modern saudi arabia lacking a base of support at the time ibn abd al wahhab s teachings were challenged by sulayman ibn muhammed al hamidi of the banu khalid the chief of al ahsa and qatif the latter threatened the ruler of the city that he would not pay him a land tax for his properties if he did not kill ibn abd al wahhab which he declined to do although ibn abd al wahhab was forced to leave ibn abd al wahhab made a name for himself through a series of actions first after he returned to al uyayna he persuaded the ruler of the town to destroy a sacred tomb revered by local muslims citing the prophet muhammed s teaching that forbade idol worship secondly he ordered that an adulteress be stoned to death a practice that had become uncommon in the area additionally he practiced the islamic concept of rihla fi talab al ilm traveling the land in order to seek knowledge the full extent of such travels remains uncertain it is known if ibn abd al wahhab spent some time in basra within modern day iraq and it is assumed that as a devout muslim he traveled to the muslim holy cities of mecca and medina before traveling to basra official sources on ibn abd al wahhab s life put his visits to these cities in different chronological order almost all sources agree that his reformist ideas were formulated while living in basra where he became somewhat famous for his debates with the islamic scholars there and wrote the kitab al tawhid the book of unity dates are missing in a great many cases so it would be impossible to reconstruct a chronology of his life up until one seven four three when the meccan epistle was written criticisms the egyptian islamic scholar abd al wahhab ibn ahamd barakat al shafi i al azhari al tandatawi wrote an early criticism of muhammed s reforms in the book kitab rad al dalala wa qam al djahala the book of the prevention of error and the suppression of ignorance oddly tandatawi did not specifically name ibn abd al wahhab in the text but referred to him as sheik al nas scholar of the people this may be seen as either an effort to not humiliate ibn abd al wahhab or to simply not draw unwanted attention to the wahhabi movement tandatawi wrote that he received word of muhammed s teachings through word of mouth and letters from local authorities the content of tandatawi s arguments also suggest this as they do not appear to be based on any writings of muhammed s instead disputing his general ideas quoting a considerable number of qu ranic verses another critic of muhammed ibn abd al wahhab at the time was a major sufi theologian ali al shafi i al basri al shahir bi l qabbani a historian at the time ibn turki considered qabbani to be among the four most prolific refuters of wahhabism particularly because unlike tandatawi he had actually read ibn abd al wahhab s writings qabbani wrote two texts criticizing ibn abd al wahhab the fasl al khitab fi radd dalalat ibn abd al wahhab the unmistakable judgement in the refutation of the delusions of ibn abd al wahhab and the kashf al hijab an wadjh dalalat ibn al wahhab lifting the veil from the face of the delusions of ibn al wahhab qabbani later wrote a formal anti wahhabi tract citing both sources from death to the present during his life muhammed ibn abd al wahhab forged a pact with najd chieftain muhammad ibn saud ensuring that regions conquered by the saudi tribe would be ruled according to ibn abd al wahhab s peculiar teachings on islam ibn saud and his heirs would spend the next one four zero years mounting various military capaigns to seize control of arabia and its outlying regions the most successful of these backed by british support would establish the present day kingdom of saudi arabia providing the wahhabi movement with a state vast wealth from oil discovered in the following decades coupled with saudi and thus wahhabi control of the holy cities of mecca and medina have since fueled wahhabi missionary activity with saudi treasure at their disposal the wahhabi muftis and imams who hold monopoly control over the nation s islamic jurisprudence and serve as arbiters of acceptable social practice in the kingdom have waged a successful campaign of proselytization abroad through the establishment of madrassas that teach the wahhabi interpretation of islam commentary as with most historical figures whose lives hold lasting influence within the world s major religions perceptions of muhammed abd al wahhab are varied to many arabs particularly those who reside in saudi arabia or whose islamic education came from saudi arabian instructors of which there are many abroad especially in the united states the united arab emirates and other islamic countries which have prominent saudis going as far as donating an islamic studies department to western universities to promote the whahabi interpretation of islam abd al wahhab is a leading luminary in the proud tradition of islamic scholarship a great number of sunni muslims regard him as a pious scholar whose interpretations of qu ran and hadith were nevertheless out of step with the mainstream of islamic thought and thus discredited to some western observers the terms wahhabism and wahhabi have become synonymous terms for islamic extremism and islamic extremist due to the events of september one one two zero zero one references gold dore

countries such as the united states japan and south korea legislation does not require any particular standard and gsm coexists with other standards such as mobile phone culture sms message on a sony ericsson handset in less than twenty years mobile phones have gone from being rare and expensive pieces of equipment used by businesses to a pervasive low cost personal item in many countries mobile phones now outnumber land line telephones with most adults and many children now owning mobile phones it is not uncommon for young adults to simply own a mobile phone instead of a land line for their residence in some developing countries where there is little existing fixed line infrastructure the mobile phone has become widespread with high levels of mobile telephone penetration a mobile culture has evolved where the phone becomes a key social tool and people rely on their mobile phone addressbook to keep in touch with their friends many people keep in touch using sms and a whole culture of texting has developed from this the commercial market in sms s is growing many phones even offer instant messenger services to increase the simplicity and ease of texting on phones cellular phones in japan offering internet capabilities such as ntt docomo s i mode offer text messaging via standard e mail the mobile phone itself has also become a totemic and fashion object with users decorating customizing and accessorizing their mobile phones to reflect their personality this has emerged as its own industry the sale of commercial ringtones exceeded two five billion in two zero zero four the use of a mobile phone is prohibited in some rail carriages mobile phone etiquette has become an important issue with mobiles ringing at funerals weddings movies and plays users often speak at increased volume which has led to places like bookshops libraries movie theatres doctor s offices and houses of worship posting signs prohibiting the use of mobile phones sometimes even installing illegal jamming equipment to prevent them many rail companies particularly those providing long distance services offer a quiet car where phone use is prohibited much like the designated non smoking cars in the past mobile phone use on aircraft is also prohibited but due to concerns of possible interference with aircraft radio communications cameraphones and videophones that can capture video and take photographs are increasingly being used to cover breaking news stories like the london bombings the indian ocean tsunami and hurricane katrina have been reported on by cameraphone users on news sites like nowpublic and photosharing sites like flickr in japan cellular phone companies provide immediate notification of earthquakes and other natural disasters to their customers free of charge in the event of an emergency disaster response crews can locate trapped or injured people using the signals from their mobile phones an interactive menu accessible through the phone s internet browser notifies the company if the user is safe or in distress mobile phone features mobile phones often have features beyond sending text messages and make voice calls including internet browsing music mp three playback personal organizers e mail built in cameras and camcorders ringtones games radio push to talk ptt infrared and bluetooth connectivity call registers and ability to watch streaming video or download video for later viewing technology mobile phones and the network they operate under vary significantly from provider to provider and even from nation to nation however all of them communicate through electromagnetic radio waves with a cell site base station the antennas of which are usually mounted on a tower pole or building the phones have a low power transceiver that transmits voice and data to the nearest cell sites usually five to one zero miles away when the cellular phone or data device is turned on it registers with the mobile telephone exchange or switch with its unique identifiers and will then be alerted by the mobile switch when there is an incoming telephone call the handset constantly listens for the strongest signal being received from the surrounding base stations as the user moves around the network the mobile device will hand off to new cell sites cell sites have relatively low power often only one or two watts radio transmitters which broadcast their presence and relay communications between the mobile handsets and the switch the switch in turn connects the call to another subscriber of the same wireless service provider or to the public telephone network which includes the networks of other wireless carriers the dialogue between the handset and the cell site is a stream of digital data that includes digitized audio except for the first generation analog networks the technology that achieves this depends on the system which the mobile phone operator has adopted some technologies include amps for analog and tdma cdma gsm gprs ev do and umts for digital communications each network operator has a unique radio frequency band controversy health controversy as with many new technologies concerns have arisen about the effects on health from using a mobile telephone there is a small amount of scientific evidence for an increase in certain types of rare tumors cancer in long time heavy users more recently a pan european study provided significant evidence of genetic damage under certain conditions some researchers also report the mobile phone industry has interfered with further research on health risks so far however the world health organization task force on emf effects on health has no definitive conclusion on the veracity of these allegations see also electromagnetic radiation hazard it is generally thought however that rf is incapable of producing any more than heating effects as it is considered non ionizing radiation in other words it lacks the energy to disrupt molecular bonds such as occurs in genetic mutations driving controversy another controversial but more lethal health concern is the correlation with road traffic accidents several studies have shown that motorists have a much higher risk of collisions and losing control of the vehicle while talking on the mobile telephone simultaneously with driving even when using hands free systems a study in the new england journal of medicine reports that drivers who used mobile phones while driving were four times more likely to crash than those who don t a rate equal to that for drunken driving at the zero one blood alcohol concentration bac level an experiment conducted by the american television show mythbusters concluded that use of mobile phones while driving poses the same risk as someone operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol accidents involving a driver being distracted by talking on a mobile phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to driving while intoxicated at least two five countries restrict or prohibit cell and other wireless technology israel japan portugal and singapore all prohibit mobile phone use while driving australia brazil chile denmark germany greece hungary italy poland the philippines romania slovenia south africa spain switzerland turkey the united kingdom and the united arab emirates prohibit the use of hand held cell phones while driving drivers in the czech republic and france may use cell phones but can be fined if they are involved in crashes while using such a device restrictive legislation has been proposed in four zero states in the us but only new york state and new jersey have passed laws regarding cell phone use and driving security concerns early mobile phones did not have much security designed in some problems with these models were cloning a variant of identity theft and scanning whereby third parties in the local area could intercept and eavesdrop in on calls analogue phones could also be listened to on some radio scanners although more recent digital systems such as gsm have attempted to address these fundamental issues security problems continue to persist vulnerabilities such as sms spoofing have been found in many current protocols that continue to allow the possibility of eavesdropping or cloning future prospects video phone there is a great deal of active research and development into mobile phone technology that is currently underway some of the improvements that are being worked on are one difficulty in adapting mobile phones to new uses is form factor for example ebooks may well become a distinct device because of conflicting form factor requirements ebooks require large screens while phones need to be smaller however this may be solved using folding e paper or built in projectors one function that would be useful in phones is a translation function currently it is only available in stand alone devices such as ectaco translators an important area of evolution relates to the man machine interface new solutions are being developed to create new mmi more easily and let manufacturers and operators experiment new concepts examples of companies that are currently developing this technology are digital airways with the kaleido product e sim mobile arsenal and qualcomm with uione for the brew environment mobile phones will include various speech technologies as they are being developed many phones already have rudimentary speech recognition in a form of voice dialing however to support more natural speech recognition and translation a drastic improvement in the state of technology in these devices is required new technologies are being explored that will utilize the extended internet and enable mobile phones to treat a barcode as a url tag phones equipped with barcode reader enabled cameras will be able to snap photos of barcodes and direct the user to corresponding sites on the internet this technology can be extended to rfid tags or even snapped pictures of company logos searches can also be personalized to local areas using a gps system built in to cell phones examples of companies that are currently developing this technology are neomedia via paperclick mobot and scanbuy another approach used by jumptag com is to map urls to short text tags tailored for easy user entry on phone keypads developments in miniaturised hard disks and flash drives to solve the storage space issue are already surfacing therefore opening a window for phones to become portable music libraries and players similar to the ipod developments in podcast software enables mobile phones to become podcast playback devices through existing channels like mms podcast j two me podcast and amr nb podcast the emergence of integration capabilities with other unlicensed access technologies such as a wimax and wlan as well as allowing handover between traditional operator networks supporting gsm cdma and umts to unlicensed mobile networks the new standard uma has been developed for this further improvements in battery life will be required colour screens and additional functions put increasing demands on the device s power source and battery developments may not proceed sufficiently fast to compensate however different display technologies such as oled displays e paper or retinal displays and smarter communication hardware directional antennae multi mode and peer to peer phones may reduce power requirements while new power technologies such as fuel cells may provide better energy capacity speculative improvements in the future may be inspired by an english team led by james auger and jimmy loizeau who in two zero zero two developed an implant designed to be inserted into a tooth during dental surgery this device consists of a radio receiver and transducer which transmits the sound via bone conduction through the jawbone into the ear sound is transmitted via radio waves from another device presumably a mobile phone and received by the implant the implant is currently powered externally given that no current power source is small enough to fit inside the tooth with it in addition the implant was only designed to receive signals not transmit them directly tapping into the inner ear or the auditory nerve is already technologically feasible and will become practical as surgical methods advance new technology in japan has combined the rfid chip principle into the handset and hooked it up to a network of readers and interfaces the system pioneered by ntt docomo and sonyericsson is called felica and there are around one zero zero zero zero convenience stores where one can now use a phone to pay for goods just by swiping it over a flat reader by charging up a phone with pre paid cash credits it can act as a sophisticated mobile phone wallet the technology is proving popular and there are now even vending machines that accept this form of payment the delivery of multimedia content including video to mobiles is beginning to become a reality with two main competing standards dmb digital multimedia broadcasting and dvb h a handset version of the digital video broadcasting standard these methods avoid swamping the network by using traditional broadcasting image scanning as seen in existing research with time this may develop into full three d texturing and modeling it is unlikely that cell phones will have the processing power to construct models and textures but it is likely that the bandwidth to communicate the video and receive a processed model will exist there are several cell phones that can perform gps positioning in the future gps positioning may be coupled with accelerometer positioning for covering underground or indoor positioning this would likely lead to maps and help finding where you are going and supports social efforts such as locating friends or group members nearby and identifying some strangers the gps technology already available in some phones while coupled with the camera phone may also allow users in the future to not only take a picture but snap the exact location and angle at which the picture was taken terminology mobile phone terms beep beep a term made popular by teenagers as in to beep beep someone this is regarding the sound of the nextel walkie talkie feature used interchangeably with chirp brick a large heavy and usually obsolete wireless mobile phone such as the motorola international three two zero zero candy bar a housing shape that has no hinges and resembles an oblong candy bar us cell phone cellular phone or cell term used currently in the united states and canada and in other countries as well during the one nine eight zero s to refer to most mobile phones it technically applies specifically to mobile phones which use a cellular network in developing mobile phone technology american electrical engineers saw the main technical problem as achieving a smooth handoff from one radio antenna to the next after they gave the name cell to the zone covered by each antenna it was a natural choice for them to apply the term cellular to both the technology and the phones that ran on it chirp a term made popular by teenagers as in to chirp someone this is regarding the sound of the nextel walkie talkie feature used interchangeably with beep beep cinderblock another name for a brick clamshell a phone that opens up to reveal the keypad microphone and earpiece these are typically more compact than other designs often called flip phones clamshell phones became very popular in the united states after the introduction of motorola s startac in one nine nine six hand phone a common pseudo english term in south east asia including south korea malaysia and singapore encompassing cell phones or any wireless phones connected to telecommunication providers handset a term used by manufacturers to refer to a mobile phone also commonly used by industry insiders hands free car kit mobile phone accessory used to talk while keeping hands on the steering wheel handy pronounced hendee a pseudo anglicism that is used in austria and germany for a mobile phone rare alternative spelling h ndi in german the word handy has the meaning of hand telefon or handgehaltenes mobiltelefon translated to english handheld mobile telephone the term possibly derived from the one nine four zero s product name handie talkie for a handheld military radio the backpack version was introduced as walkie talkie mobile short for mobile phone in the sense of cellular phone a term in everyday usage in some english speaking countries such as the uk and australia also commonly used by industry insiders in america although with a different pronunciation mobile phone a term covering cellular phones satellite phones and any phones giving wide

handsets unlike mobile phones cordless phones use private base stations that are not shared between subscribers the base station is connected to a land line professional mobile radio professional mobile radio systems are very similar to cell phone systems and attempts have even been made to use tetra the international digital pmr standard to implement public mobile networks but normally pmr systems are sufficiently separate from the phone network to not really be considered phones but rather radios radio phone this is a term which covers radios which could connect into the telephone

state in the new england region of the united states it is probably named after the french province of maine another possibility for the name maine is that the people living on islands along the coast of maine used to speak of going to the mainland as going over to the main the state experiences a continental climate much more so in the southern part of the state with fahrenheit temperatures dipping into the two zero s and one zero s in the winter and eight zero s and nine zero s in the summer wind chill often reduces the winter temperature to lows beyond two zero four u s navy ships have been named uss maine in honor of the state history the original inhabitants of the territory that is now maine were algonquian speaking peoples including the wabanaki passamaquoddy and penobscots the first european settlement in maine was in one six zero four by a french party that included samuel de champlain the noted explorer the french named the area that includes maine as acadia english colonists sponsored by the plymouth company settled in one six zero seven the coastal areas of western maine first became the province of maine in a one six two two land patent eastern maine north of the kennebec river was more sparsely settled and was known in the one seven th century as the territory of sagadahock the province within its current boundaries became part of massachusetts bay colony in one six five two maine was much fought over by the french and english during the one seven th and early one eight th centuries after the defeat of the french in the one seven four zero s the territory from the penobscot river east fell under the nominal authority of the province of nova scotia and together with present day new brunswick formed the nova scotia county of sunbury with its court of general sessions at campobello american and british forces contended for maine s territory during the american revolution and the war of one eight one two the treaty concluding revolution was ambiguous about maine s boundary with british north america the territory of maine was confirmed as part of massachusetts when the united states was formed although the final border with british territory was not established until the webster ashburton treaty of one eight four two because it was physically separated from the rest of massachusetts and was growing in population at a rapid rate it became the two three rd state on march one five one eight two zero through the missouri compromise this compromise allowed admitting both maine and missouri in one eight two one into the union while keeping a balance between slave and free states maine s original capital was portland until one eight three two when it was moved to augusta law and government the capital of maine is augusta and its governor is john baldacci democrat its two u s senators are susan collins republican and olympia snowe republican maine s politics are notable for several reasons and are dramatic in the one nine three zero s it was one of very few states which remained dominated by the republican party in the one nine three six presidential election franklin d roosevelt received the electoral votes of every state other than maine and vermont beginning in the one nine six zero s maine began to lean toward the democrats especially in presidential elections in one nine six eight hubert humphrey became just the second democrat in half a century to carry maine thanks to the presence of his running mate maine senator edmund muskie maine has since become a left leaning swing state but has voted democratic in four straight presidential elections casting its votes for bill clinton twice al gore in two zero zero zero and john kerry with five three six of the vote in two zero zero four republican strength is greatest in washington and piscataquis counties though democrats have carried the state in presidential elections in recent years republicans have largely maintained their control of the state s u s senate seats with ed muskie and george mitchell being the only maine democrats serving in the u s senate in the past fifty years maine voters tend to accept independent and third party candidates more frequently than most states maine has had two independent governors recently james b longley one nine seven five one nine seven nine and angus king one nine nine five two zero zero three the reform party of ross perot achieved a great deal here in the presidential elections of one nine nine two and one nine nine six in one nine nine two perot came in second to bill clinton despite the longtime presence of the bush family summer home in kennebunkport and in one nine nine six maine was again perot s best state the green party candidate won nine percent of the vote in the two zero zero two gubernatorial election more than in any election for a statewide office for that party the green party also elected john eder to the office of state representative in maine its highest elected official nationwide maine politicians republicans and democrats alike are noted for having more moderate views than many in their party since one nine six nine two of maine s four electoral votes are awarded based on the winner of the statewide election the other two go to the highest vote winner in each of the state s two congressional districts famous politicians from maine include james blaine edmund muskie margaret chase smith william cohen george j mitchell john baldacci olympia snowe hannibal hamlin susan collins owen brewster and percival baxter maine is an

maine also has several unique geographical features machias seal island off its easternmost point is claimed by both the usa and canada and is the only u s land area still in dispute with respect to sovereignty also in this easternmost area is the old sow the largest tidal whirlpool in the world maine is the most sparsely populated state east of the mississippi river owing in part to its huge relative size its land mass exceeds that of all other new england states combined it is appropriately called the pine tree state as nine zero percent of its land is forest in the forested areas of the interior there is much uninhabited land some of which does not even have formal political organization into local units for example the northwest aroostook maine territory in the far north is listed as having an area of two six six eight square miles and a population of two seven or one person for every one zero zero square miles maine is equally well known for its dramatic ocean scenery west quoddy head is the easternmost piece of land in the contiguous four eight united states along the famous rock bound coast of maine are lighthouses sandy beaches quiet fishing villages and thousands of offshore islands including the isles of shoals which straddles the new hampshire border jagged rocks and cliffs and thousands of bays and inlets add to the rugged beauty of maine s coast just inland by contrast is the view of sparkling lakes rushing rivers green forests and towering mountains this visual contrast of forested slopes sweeping down to the sea has been aptly summed up by american poetess edna st vincent millay of rockland and camden maine in renascence all i could see from where i stood was three long mountains and a wood i turned and looked the other way and saw three islands and a bay more prosaic geologists describe this type of landscape as a drowned coast where a rising sea level has invaded former land features creating bays out of valleys and islands out of mountain tops in the case of maine there has been a partially offsetting rise in land also due to the melting of heavy glacier ice which caused a rebounding effect of underlying rock however this land rise was not strong enough to eliminate all the effect of the rising sea level and its invasion of some former land features millions of ordinary americans have enjoyed this coastal scenery at maine s acadia national park the only national park in new england the noted american ecologist rachel carson did much of her research at one of the maine seacoast s most characteristic features a tide pool for her

halifax nova scotia in the mid one nine zero zero s in two zero zero one maine s largest city surpassed boston as new england s busiest port by tonnage due to its ability to handle large tankers maine has a small trapping industry which with three one five seven resident trappers is nevertheless larger than that of most eastern states source portland press herald january two three two zero zero five note many trappers are part time the principal pelt taken by value is beaver historically however beaver trapping was much more significant in the north woods and canadian maritimes than the small industry of today and was the cause of much early wealth and many trading settlements maine has very few large companies that maintain headquarters in the state and fewer than before due to consolidations and mergers particularly in the pulp and paper industry structurally this could be a weakness in an economy that depends on extracting forest and sea resources because decisions that affect the long range stability of the resource base are being made in distant locations which do not have to live on a day to day basis with the consequences of their policies some of the very few large companies that do maintain headquarters in maine include fairchild semiconductor south portland idexx laboratories a large veterinary biotech company in westbrook and the famous outdoor supply retailer l l bean freeport maine is also the home of the jackson laboratory a non profit institution and the world s largest mammalian genetic research facility demographics as of two zero zero five maine has an estimated population of one three two one five zero five which is an increase of six five two zero or zero five from the prior year and an increase of four six five eight two or three seven since the year two zero zero zero this includes a natural increase since the last census of six four one three people that is seven one two seven six births minus six four eight six three deaths and an increase due to net migration of four one eight zero eight people into the state immigration from outside the united states resulted in a net increase of five zero zero four people and migration within the country produced a net increase of three six eight zero four people maine is a popular tourist destination but it also experiences harsh winters and consequently the great temporary influx of visitors occurs during the warmer months many of these visitors establish an alternate secondary residence in maine during some or all warm months and then depart for their primary residence in the off season these are the summer people of maine lore official census figures normally count a person as a resident only once at the place of the primary home therefore there are some situations in which official census figures could be misleading for maine for example some communities may have a much larger seasonal retail sector than their official small population figure would imply as explained in detail under geography there are large tracts of uninhabited land in some remote parts of the interior maine population density map race and ancestry the racial makeup of the

montana states of the american west states of the united states machine translation sometimes referred to by the acronym mt is a sub field of computational linguistics that investigates the use of computer software to translate text or speech in between natural languages at its basic level mt performs simple substitution of atomic words in one natural language for words in another using corpus techniques more complex translations can be performed allowing for better handling of differences in linguistic typology phrase recognition and translation of idioms as well as the isolation of anomalies however current systems are unable to produce output of the same quality as a human translator particularly where the text to be translated uses casual language the product is sometimes called a gisting translation unless one is proficient in both languages mt will often produce only a rough translation that will at best allow the reader to get the gist of the source text but is unlikely to convey a complete understanding of it the user may find the raw translation sufficiently useful as it is modern high end mt software such as that produced by systran promt or ibm allows for customization by domain or profession such as weather reports improving output by limiting the scope of allowable substitutions this technique is particularly effective in domains where formal or formulaic language is used improved output quality can also be achieved by human intervention for example some systems are able to translate more accurately if the user has unambiguously identified which words in the text are names with the assistance of these techniques mt has proven useful as a tool to assist human translators and in some cases can even produce output that can be used as is in the words of the european association for machine translation eamt machine translation mt is the application of computers to the task of translating texts from one natural language to another one of the very earliest pursuits in computer science mt has proved to be an elusive goal but today a number of systems are available which produce output which if not perfect is of sufficient quality to be useful in a number of specific domains one nine nine seven introduction the translation process whether for translation can be stated simply as decoding the meaning of the source text and re encoding this meaning in the target language behind this simple procedure there lies a complex cognitive operation for example to decode the meaning of the source text in its entirety the translator must interpret and analyse all the features of the text a process which requires in depth knowledge of both the grammar semantics syntax idioms and the like of the source language as well as the culture of its speakers the translator needs the same in depth knowledge to re encode the meaning in the target language therein lies the challenge in machine translation how to program a computer to understand a text as a human being does and also to create a new text in the source language that sounds as if it has been written by a human this problem can be tackled in a number of ways approaches machine translation can use a method based on linguistic rules which means that words will be translated in a linguistic way the most suitable orally speaking words of the target language will replace the ones in the source language it is often argued that the success of machine translation requires the problem of natural language understanding to be solved first a number of heuristic methods of machine translation are also used for machine translation including rule based methods lexical lookup methods grammar based methods semantics based methods knowledge based machine translation statistical methods statistical machine translation example based methods dictionary entry based methods linguistic rules based methods generally rule based methods parse a text usually creating an intermediary symbolic representation from which the text in the target language is generated according to the nature of the intermediary representation an approach is described as interlingual machine translation or transfer based machine translation these methods require extensive lexicons with morphological syntactic and semantic information and large sets of rules statistical based and example based methods eschew manual lexicon building and rule writing and instead try to generate translations based on bilingual text corpora such as the canadian hansard corpus the english french record of the canadian parliament where such corpora are available impressive results can be achieved translating texts of a similar kind but such corpora are still very rare given enough data machine translation programs often work well enough for a native speaker of one language to get the approximate meaning of what is written by the other native speaker i e producing what is called a gisting translation the difficulty is getting enough data of the right kind to support the particular method for example the large multilingual corpus of data needed for statistical methods to work is not necessary for the grammar based methods but then the grammar methods need a skilled linguist to carefully design the grammar that they use history the first attempts at machine translation were conducted after world war ii it was assumed at this time that the newly invented computers would have no trouble in translating texts the logic was that computers were able to do complex mathematics quickly something that humans did with more difficulty on the other hand even young children were able to learn to understand human language therefore computers could do the same in actual fact this belief was soon shown to be incorrect on seven january one nine five four the georgetown ibm experiment the first public demonstration of a mt system was held in new york at the head office of ibm the demonstration was widely reported in the newspapers and received much public interest the system itself however was no more than what today would be called a toy system having just two five zero words and translating just four nine carefully selected russian sentences into english mainly in the field of chemistry nevertheless it encouraged the view that mt was imminent and in particular stimulated the financing of mt research not just in the us but worldwide the first serious mt systems were used during the cold war to parse texts in russian scientific journals the rough translations produced were sufficient to understand the gist of the articles if an article discussed a subject deemed to be of security interest it was sent to a human translator for a complete translation if not it was discarded the governmental support was however cut down in one nine six six after the report of alpac a committee established in order to review the investments which considered that machine translation despite the expenses was not likely to reach the quality of a human translator although the alpac report had tremendous impact on research in machine translation there were notable exceptions systran for example managed to attract commercial and defense security customers and survived the decrease of direct governmental funding limited field of use systems have also been successful in a number of specialized applications for instance the taum meteo system has been used in canada since one nine seven seven to translate weather reports from english to french meteo system today translates close to eight zero zero zero zero words a day or three zero million words a year the advent of low cost and more powerful computers towards the end of the two zero th century brought mt to the masses as did the availability of sites on the internet they are of particular interest to countries in east asia wishing to export to the north american and european markets much of the effort previously spent on mt research however has shifted to the development of computer assisted translation cat systems such as translation memories which are seen to be more successful and profitable users despite their inherent limitations mt programs are currently used by various organisations around the world probably the largest institutional user is the european commission which uses a highly customised version of the commercial mt system systran to handle the automatic translation of a large volume of preliminary drafts of documents for internal use a danish translation agency lingtech a s has been translating patent applications from english to danish since one nine nine three using a proprietary rule based machine translation system patrans working together with the translation memory based trados commercial cat tool the system requires manual pre and post editing but the monthly output is still approx four zero zero zero zero zero words per operator in spain the magazine entitled peri dico de catalunya a daily newspaper is translated into catalan or spanish through a mt system maybe this first fully operational mt system for unrestricted texts is producing nearly one zero zero satisfactory results it has been reported that in april two zero zero three microsoft began using a hybrid mt system for the translation of a database of technical support documents from english to spanish the system was developed internally by microsoft s natural language research group the group is currently testing an english japanese system as well as bringing english french and english german systems online the latter two systems use a learned language generation component whereas the first two have manually developed generation components the systems were developed and trained using translation memory databases with over a million sentences each with the recent focus on terrorism the military sources in us invest significant amounts of money in natural language engineering in q tel a venture capital fund largely funded by the us intelligence community to stimulate new technologies through private sector entrepreneurs brought up companies like language weaver information processing technology office in darpa hosts programs like tides and babylon us air force has awarded a one million contract to develop a language translation technology currently the military community is interested in translation and processing of languages like arabic pashto and dari evaluation there are various methods for evaluating the performance of machine translation systems the oldest is by using human judges to tell the quality of a translation newer automated methods include bleu nist and meteor machine translation vs computer assisted translation although the two concepts are similar machine translation mt should not be confused with computer assisted translation cat also known as machine assisted translation mat in machine translation the translator supports the machine that is to say that the computer or program translates the text which is then edited by the translator whereas in computer assisted translation the computer program supports the translator who translates the text himself making all the essential decisions involved see also artificial intelligence computer assisted translation distributed language

whole preceding period of eleven years that passed between his father s captivity at angora and his own final victory over his brother musa at chamurli for nineteen years therefore was a ruler over his people and his memory is still deservedly cherished and honoured among them he was buried in bursa in a mausoleum erected by himself near the celebrated mosque which he built there and which from its decorations of green porcelain is called the green mosque this edifice is said to be the most beautiful specimen of saracenie architecture and carving that is in existence mahomet i also completed the vast and magnificent mosque at bursa which his grandfather murat i had commenced but which had been neglected during in reign of beyazit it is deserving of mention that mehmet founded in the vicinity of his own mosque and mausoleum two characteristic institutions one a school and one a refectory for the poor both of which he endowed with royal munificence the reign of this sultan is cited by von hammer as the period total taste for literature and fondness for poetry first prevailed among the ottomans he was a liberal patron of intellectual merit and the name of an early literary

zmece mustafa from confinement and acknowledged him as the legitimate heir to the throne of beyazit having first stipulated with him that he should if successful repay the greek emperor for his liberation by cessation of a large number of important cities the pretender was landed by the byzantine galleys in the european domination of the sultan and for a time made rapid progress large bodies

he tried to quell the corruption that had grown during the previous sultans and that had not been checked while his mother was ruling through proxy this was achieved through numerous ways such as limiting wasteful spending he also banned alcohol and tobacco in istanbul he ordered execution for breaking this ban he would patrol the streets and taverns of stanbul in civilian clothes at night policing the enforcement of his command if while patrolling the streets he saw a soldier using tobacco or alcohol he killed the soldier on the spot with his sword his harshness was the reason for his

musical saw a musical instrument plucked from the toolshed the musical saw is often a standard manual wood cutting saw however it is often the case that professional sawyers might opt for a custom made musical saw these saws generally have a longer blade for a greater range thinner metal for sweeter notes and are cut from the original sheet so the grain of the metal runs parallel to the cutting edge of the saw providing cleaner vibrations custom or no the saw is generally played seated although a few sawyers perform while standing using a style reminiscent to the seated method with the handle squeezed between the legs the cutting edge facing away from the body and the far business end held with one hand the player creates sound by bending the saw into a lopsided s shape the top curve is imperceptible and drawing a bow across the bottom curve the pitch produced depends on where one draws the bow and the shape of the curves for sustained notes and increased volume sawyers often use vibrato by a quick sustained vibration of one of the legs it is also possible to play this instrument by tapping it with a mallet rather than drawing a bow a particular practitioner in the late twentieth century was fond of substituting his harmonica for a mallet thus being able to say that he was playing the saw with the harmonica however produced the sound made has an eerie vocal quality the musical saw though not normally struck when played is often considered a percussion instrument in any case it is classified as an idiophone under the hornbostel sachs system of musical instrument classification musical saws have been produced for over a century in the early one nine zero zero s there were at least ten companies in the united states alone manufacturing saws these saws ranged from the familiar steel variety to gold plated masterpieces worth hundreds of dollars however with the start of world war ii the demand for metals made the manufacture of saws too expensive and many of these companies went out of business by the year two zero zero zero only three companies in the u s were still making saws musicalsaw com mussehl westphal and blacklock two other important companies exist in the saw world sandvik maker of the stradivarius saw and a company in france which produces a toothless saw with a range of three octaves a famous performer on the musical

pitch instruments musical instrument digital interface or midi is an industry standard electronic communications protocol that defines each musical note in an electronic musical instrument such as a synthesizer precisely and concisely allowing electronic musical instruments and computers to exchange data or talk with each other midi does not transmit audio it simply transmits digital information about a music performance the midi show control msc protocol in the real time system exclusive subset is an industry standard ratified by the midi manufacturers association in one nine nine one which allows all types of media control devices to talk with each other and with computers to perform show control functions in live and canned entertainment applications just like musical midi above msc does not transmit the actual show media it simply transmits digital information about a multimedia performance almost all music recordings today utilize midi as a key enabling technology for recording music in addition midi is also used to control hardware including recording devices as well as live performance equipment such as stage lights and effects pedals lately midi has exploded onto the scene with its adoption into mobile phones midi is used to play back the ringtones of midi capable phones midi is also used to provide game music in some video games the midi standard was first proposed by dave smith in one nine eight one in a paper to the audio engineering society and the midi specification one zero was published in august one nine eight three midi allows computers synthesizers sound cards samplers and drum machines to control one another and to exchange system information though modern computer sound cards are midi compatible and capable of creating realistic instrument sounds the fact that sound cards midi synthesizers have historically produced sounds of dubious quality has tarnished the image of a general purpose computer as a midi instrument this despite the fact that the midi specification itself has nothing to do with the quality of the sound produced which varies depending on the sound card used midi is almost directly responsible for bringing an end to the wall of synthesizers phenomenon in one nine seven zero s eight zero s rock music concerts when keyboard instrument performers were sometimes hidden behind banks of various instruments following the advent of midi many synthesizers were released in rack mount versions enabling performers to control multiple instruments from a single keyboard another important effect of midi has been the development of hardware and computer based sequencers which can be used to record edit and play back performances synchronization of midi sequences is made possible by the use of midi timecode an implementation of the smpte time code standard using midi messages and midi timecode has become the standard for digital music synchronization a number of music file formats have been based on the midi bytestream these formats are very compact often a file of only one zero kilobytes can produce a full minute of music how midi works in a nutshell how musical midi works when a note is played on a midi aware instrument it transmits midi messages a typical midi message sequence corresponding to a key being struck and released on a keyboard is the user started playing the middle c note with the specified velocity volume the user changed the force with which he is holding the key down can be repeated optional the user stopped playing the middle c note other performance parameters would also be transmitted for example if the pitch wheel were being turned that information would also be transmitted using different midi messages the musical instrument does this completely autonomously requiring only that the musician play a note or do something else that generates midi messages all notes that a musical instrument is capable of playing are assigned specific midi messages according to what the note and octave are for example the middle c note played on any midi compatible musical instrument will always transmit the same midi message from its midi out port which midi message and thus which binary digits will be transmitted upon playing of a certain note are defined in the midi specification and this comprises the core of the midi standard all midi compatible instruments follow the midi specification and thus transmit identical midi messages for identical midi events such as the playing of a certain note on the musical instrument since they follow a published standard all midi instruments can communicate with and understand each other as well as with computers which have been programmed to understand midi messages using midi aware software the midi interface converts the current fluctuations transmitted by a midi musical instrument into binary numbers that the receiving musical instrument or computer can process all midi compatible instruments have a built in midi interface in addition computer sound cards usually have a built in midi interface if not it can be separately purchased as a card and easily installed how midi show control works when any cue is called by a user typically a stage manager and or preprogrammed timeline in a show control software application the show controller transmits one or more real time system exclusive messages from its midi out port a typical msc message sequence is the user just called a cue the cue is for lighting device three the cue is number four five eight the cue is in cue list seven for more details please see midi show control this section has been shortened because of the size of this article the midi specification electrical connections midi ports and cable the midi standard consists of a communications messaging protocol designed for use with musical instruments as well as a physical interface standard physically it consists of a one way simplex digital current loop serial communications electrical connection signaling at three one two five zero bits per second only one end of the loop is referenced to ground with the other end floating to prevent ground loops from producing analog audio interference and hum the current loop on the transmitter side drives the led of an opto coupler on the receiver side this means the devices are in fact optically isolated the opto coupler must be a high speed type as most opto couplers have asymmetrical switching times delays for switching on are different from the delays when switching off they distort the signal the zero to one relations if several midi devices are connected in series by daisy chaining the midi thru to the next devices midi in the signal gets more and more distorted until receive errors happen because the pulses get too narrow midi connectors use standard five pin din connectors which at one time were a de facto european standard for audio interconnection over time the simpler american rca phono jack has replaced din in this application leaving midi as the only place they are commonly encountered in modern equipment standard size din connectors were also used for computer keyboard connections from the early eight zero s through the late nine zero s and have generally been replaced by mini din connectors computers have one five pin d sub connectors that are used for midi in out or joystick connection the recommended method of connecting two five pin din cables to one five pin d sub computer port can be found at midi org web site the midi specification very conservatively states that the maximum distance midi can be transmitted is five zero feet or one five m but it can normally go much further there is a usb connection standard and a standard for midi over ethernet and internet called rtp midi being developed by the ietf see external links below for further information message format each one way connection called a port can transmit or receive standard musical messages such as note on note off controllers which include volume pedal modulation signals etc pitch bend program change aftertouch channel pressure and system related messages these signals are sent along with one of one six channel identifiers the channels are used to separate voices or instruments somewhat like tracks in a multi track mixer the ability to multiplex one six channels onto a single wire makes it possible to control several instruments at once using a single midi connection when a midi instrument is capable of producing several independent sounds simultaneously a multitimbral instrument midi channels are used to address these sections independently this should not be confused with polyphonic the ability to play several notes simultaneously in the same voice note messages can represent any note from c i e five octaves below middle c or eight one seven five hz in common western musical tuning designated as midi note zero to g i e five octaves above the g above middle c or one two five five seven hz designated as midi note one two seven with precision down to the semitone pitch bend messages range in two semitones sometimes adjustable with registered parameter numbers with precision of one eight one nine two semitone the human ear cannot hear the difference between adjacent pure tones that differ by less than one two zero semitone continuous controllers are quite versatile they can usually be controlled by a musician using knobs sliders footswitches or pressure on the instrument they can be used to change the tone timbre or volume of a sound move motorized faders and even dim lights program change messages are sent to an instrument on a particular channel to instruct it to recall another patch or program the midi protocol uses seven bits for this message supporting only one two eight program changes many devices which are more modern than the midi specification store far more than one two eight programs to overcome the limitation a bank switching method has been added to the spec each bank of one two seven programs can be selected using a controller message enabling access to one two seven two programs aftertouch messages also known as poly pressure messages are sent in some instruments to indicate pressure changes on the note while it is being played similarly channel pressure changes the pressure for the entire instrument not just one note the channel pressure messages are more commonly implemented in most synthesizers while the individual pressure sensors that aftertouch messages require are reserved mainly for expensive high end synthesizers manufacturer s system exclusive messages also known as manufacturer sysex manuf sysx etc are defined by the manufacturer of the sequencer synthesizer and can be any length these messages are commonly used to send non midi data over a midi connection such as a synthesizer instrument sample or settings and a sequencer s memory dump because they are defined by the device s manufacturer they are mainly used for backup purposes and rarely if ever useful in another midi device real time system exclusive messages include the significant midi show control extension which enables all types of entertainment equipment to easily communicate with each other through the process of show control system messages contain meta information about other midi messages a sequencer for example often sends midi clock messages during playback that correspond to the midi timecode so the device receiving the messages usually a synthesizer will be able to keep time also some devices will send active sense messages used only to keep the connection between the sender and the receiver alive after all midi communication has ceased it should be noted that midi can be used to provide facilities for playing in nonstandard musical tunings however apart from using pitch bend to control each note these features are not standardized across all instruments in out thru most midi capable instruments feature a midi in midi out and occasionally a midi thru connection in the form of five pin din plugs in order to build a two way physical connection between two devices a pair of cables must be used the midi thru jack simply echoes the signal entering the device at midi in this makes it possible to control several devices from a single source daisy chaining of multiple devices on a single port can be accomplished using the midi thru port this technique is generally limited to three devices in a row due to latency the latency is caused by the fact that midi in ports are optically isolated instead of making a physical connection to pass electrical signals the electrical signals arriving at the midi in port turn an led on and off which is read by a photo sensor this physical break in the flow of electricity prevents the forming of ground loops it also introduces a small amount of latency generally after travelling through three devices in a daisy chain this latency becomes noticeable the one nine eight five atari st was the first home computer to sport the original five pin format which made the st a very popular platform for running midi sequencer software most pc soundcards from the late one nine nine zero s had the ability to terminate a midi connection usually through a midi in midi out converter on the game port the game port has been supplanted in the modern pc by usb devices and so typically a pc owner will need to purchase a midi interface that attaches to the usb or firewire port of their machine to use midi general midi in midi instruments one per channel are selected by number zero one two seven using the program change message however the basic midi one zero specification did not specify what instrument sound piano tuba etc corresponds to each number this was intentional as midi originated as a professional music protocol and in that context it is typical for a performer to assemble a custom palette of instruments appropriate for their particular repertoire rather than taking a least common denominator approach eventually interest developed in adapting midi as a consumer format and for computer multimedia applications in this context in order for midi file content to be portable the instrument program numbers used must call up the same instrument sound on every player general midi gm was an attempt by the midi manufacturer s association mma to resolve this problem by standardizing an instrument program number map so that for example program change one always results in a piano sound on all gm compliant players gm also specified the response to certain other midi messages in a more controlled manner than the midi one zero specification the gm spec is maintained and published by the midi manufacturer s association mma from a musical perspective gm has a mixed reputation mainly because of small or large audible differences in corresponding instrument sounds across player implementations the limited size of the instrument palette one two eight instruments its least common denominator character and the inability to add customized instruments to suit the needs of the particular piece yet the gm instrument set is still included in most midi instruments and from a standardization perspective gm has proven durable later companies in japan s association of musical electronics industry sic amei developed general midi level two gm two incorporating aspects of the yamaha xg and roland gs formats extending the instrument palette specifying more message responses in detail and defining new messages for custom tuning scales and more the gm two specs are maintained and published by the mma and amei later still gm two became the basis of scalable polyphony midi sp midi a midi variant for mobile applications where different players may have different numbers of musical voices sp midi is a component of the three gpp mobile phone terminal multimedia architecture starting from release five gm gm two and sp midi are also the basis for selecting player provided instruments in several of the mma amei xmf file formats xmf type zero type one and mobile xmf which allow extending the instrument palette with custom instruments in the downloadable sound dls formats addressing another major gm shortcoming low bandwidth midi messages are extremely compact due to the low bandwidth of the connection and the need for near real time accuracy most messages consist of a status byte channel number in the low four bits and an opcode in the high four bits followed by one or two data bytes however the serial nature of midi messages means that long strings of midi messages take an appreciable time to send and many people can hear those delays especially when dealing with dense musical information or when many channels are particularly active running status is a convention that allows the status byte to be omitted if it would be the same as that of the previous message helping to mitigate bandwidth issues somewhat midi file formats midi messages along with timing information can be collected and stored in a computer file system in what is commonly called a midi file or more formally a standard midi file smf the smf specification was developed by and is maintained by the midi manufacturers association mma midi files are typically created using desktop laptop computer based sequencing software or sometimes a hardware based midi instrument or workstation that organizes midi messages into one or more parallel tracks for independent recording and editing in most but not all sequencers each track is assigned to a specific midi channel and or a specific general midi instrument patch although most current midi sequencer software uses proprietary session file formats rather than smf almost all sequencers provide export or save as support for the smf format an smf consists of one header chunk and one or more track chunks there are three smf formats the format is encoded in the file header format zero contains a single track and represents a single song performance format one may contain any number of tracks enabling preservation of the sequencer track structure and also represents a single song performance format two may have any number of tracks each representing a separate song performance format two is not commonly supported by sequencers nor commonly found in the wild large collections of smfs can be found on the web most commonly with the extension mid these files are most frequently authored with the assumption that they will be played on general midi players but not always occasional unintended bad sounding playback is the result midi karaoke which uses the kar file extension files are an unofficial extension of midi files used to add synchronized lyrics to standard midi files most smf players do not display these lyrics however numerous kar specific players are available these often display the lyrics synchronized with the music in follow the bouncing ball fashion essentially turning any pc into a karaoke machine note kar files can often be played by smf players if the filename extension is changed to mid the midi manufacturer s association has now defined a new family of file formats xmf extensible music file some of which package smf chunks with instrument data in dls format downloadable sounds also an mma specification to much the same effect as mod files the xmf container is a binary format not xml based rmi file on microsoft windows the system itself uses riff based midi file with rmi extension midi usage and applications extensions of the midi standard usb firewire and ethernet embeddings of midi are now commonly available and in the long run the proposed midi over ethernet and internet standard called rtp midi being developed by the ietf is likely to replace the old current loop implementation of midi as well as providing the high bandwidth channel that zipi was intended to provide see external links below for further information in one nine nine two the midi tuning standard or mts was ratified by the midi manufacturers association while support for this standard is not great it is supported by some instruments and software in particular the free software program timidity supports it mts uses three bytes which can be thought of as a three digit number base one two eight to specify a pitch in logarithmic form use of mts allows any midi file to be tuned in any way desired something which can be accomplished using the freeware program scala program beyond midi although traditional midi connections work well for most purposes in one nine nine four a new high bandwidth standard zipi sponsored by uc berkeley s cnmat was proposed to replace midi with incompatible but very similar message system it was not based on channels instead shifting the control to individual notes on each device channel messages were emulated by grouping note messages the protocol failed to gain any acceptance primarily due to lack of demand the open sound control or osc protocol developed by the same team transcends some of midi s musical coding limitations and is considered by some to be technically superior osc has been implemented in software like supercollider pure data isadora max msp csound and chuck however at present few mainstream musical applications and no standalone instruments support osc making whole studio interoperability problematic it can run over ethernet connections osc is not owned by any private company however it is also not maintained by any standards organization yamaha has its mlan protocol which is a based on firewire and carries multiple midi message channels and multiple audio channels mlan is a proprietary protocol open for licensing a proposal for high definition midi hd midi extension is now being discussed by members of the mma this major update to midi would provide greater resolution in data values increase the number of midi channels and support the creation of entirely new kinds of midi messages this work involves representatives from all sizes and types of companies from the smallest specialty show control operations to the largest musical equipment manufacturers see also new interfaces for musical expression other applications of midi midi can also be used for applications other than music show control theatre lighting special effects sound design recording system synchronization audio processor control computer networking as demonstrated by the early first person shooter game midi maze one nine eight seven any device built with a standard midi out port should in theory be able to control any other device with a midi in port providing that developers of both devices have the same understanding about the semantic meaning of all the transmitted midi messages this agreement can come either because both follow the published midi specifications or else because for non standard functionality the message meanings are agreed upon by both manufacturers midi controller is used in two senses in one sense a controller is hardware or software which generates and transmits midi data to midi enabled devices in the other more technical sense a midi controller is an abstraction of the hardware used to control a performance but which is not directly related to note on note off events a slider assigned to open and close a low pass filter on a synthesizer may be assigned to controller one eight for example changes in the position of the slider are transmitted along with one eight so that they are distinguished from changes in the value of other controllers midi controllers which are hardware and software the following are classes of midi controller the human interface component of a traditional instrument redesigned as a midi input device the most common type of device in this class is the keyboard controller such a device provides a musical keyboard and perhaps other actuators pitch bend and modulation wheels for example but produces no sound on its own it is intended only to drive other midi devices percussion controllers such as the roland octapad fall into this class as do guitar like controllers such as the synthaxe and a variety of wind controllers electronic musical instruments including synthesizers samplers drum machines and electronic drums which are used to perform music in real time and are inherently able to transmit a midi data stream of the performance pitch to midi converters including guitar synthesizers analyze a pitch and convert it into a midi signal there are several devices which do this for the human voice and for monophonic instruments such as flutes for example traditional instruments such as drums pianos and accordions which are outfitted with sensors and a computer which accepts input from the sensors and transmits real time performance information as midi data sequencers which store and retrieve midi data and send the data to midi enabled instruments in order to reproduce a performance midi machine control mmc devices such as recording equipment which transmit messages to aid in the synchronization of midi enabled devices for example a recorder may have a feature to index a recording by measure and beat the sequencer that it controls would stay synchronized with it as the recorder s transport controls are pushed and corresponding midi messages transmitted midi controllers in the data stream modifiers such as modulation wheels pitch bend wheels sustain pedals pitch sliders buttons knobs faders switches ribbon controllers etc alter an instrument s state of operation and thus can be used to modify sounds or other parameters of music performance in real time via midi connections the one two eight virtual midi controllers and their electronic messages connect the actual buttons knobs wheels sliders etc with their intended actions within the receiving device some controllers such as pitch bend are special whereas the data range of most continuous controllers such as volume for example consists of one two eight steps ranging in value from zero to one two seven pitch bend data may be encoded with over one six zero zero zero data steps this produces the illusion of a continuously sliding pitch as in a violin s portamento rather than a series of zippered steps such as a guitarist sliding his finger up the frets of his guitar s neck thus the pitch wheel on a midi keyboard may generate large amounts of data which can lead to a slowdown of data throughput many sequencers can thin pitch bend or other continuous controller data by keeping only a set number of messages per second or keeping only messages that change the controller by at least a certain amount the original midi spec included one two eight virtual controller numbers for real time modifications to live instruments or their audio midi show control

technology computer file formats music file formats a microprogram implements a cpu instruction set just as a single high level language statement is compiled to a series of machine instructions load store shift etc each machine instruction is in turn implemented by a series of microinstructions sometimes called a microprogram the most common term is microcode not microprogram on most computers the microcode is not produced by a compiler but exists in a special high speed memory the microcode is written by the cpu engineer during the design phase in some computers the microcode is in ram and can be altered to correct bugs in the instruction set or to implement new machine instructions microcode can also allow one computer microarchitecture to emulate another usually more complex architecture the elements composing the microprogram exist on a lower conceptual level than the more familiar assembler instructions each element is differentiated by the micro prefix to avoid confusion microprogram microcode microinstruction microassembler etc microprograms are carefully designed and optimized for the fastest possible execution since a slow microprogram would yield a slow machine instruction which would in turn cause all programs using that to be slow the microprogrammer must have extensive low level hardware knowledge of the computer circuitry as the microcode controls this the memory in which the cpu s microcode resides is called a control store the microcode may be stored in rom as a form of firmware or loaded into ram memory as part of the initialization of the central processing unit microprograms consist of series of microinstructions these microinstructions control the computer s central processing unit cpu at a very fundamental level for example a single typical microinstruction might specify the following operations connect register one to the a side of the alu connect register seven to the b side of the alu set the alu to perform two s complement addition set the alu s carry input to zero store the result value in register eight update the condition codes with the alu status flags negative zero overflow and carry microjump to micropc nnn for the next microinstruction to simultaneously control all of these features the microinstruction is often very wide for example five six bits or more the reason for microprogramming microcode was originally developed as a simpler method of developing the control logic for a computer initially cpu instruction sets were hard wired each machine instruction add shift move was implemented directly with circuitry this provided fast performance but as instruction sets grew more complex hard wired instruction sets became more difficult to design and debug microcode alleviated that problem by allowing cpu design engineers to write a microprogram to implement a machine instruction rather than design circuitry for that even late in the design process microcode could easily be changed whereas hard wired instructions could not this greatly facilitated cpu design and led to more complex instruction sets another advantage of microcode was the implementation of more complex machine instructions in the one nine six zero s through the late one nine seven zero s much programming was done in assembly language a symbolic equivalent of machine instructions the more abstract and higher level the machine instruction the greater the programmer productivity the ultimate extension of this were directly executable high level language designs in these each statement of a high level language such as pl one would be entirely and directly executed by microcode without compilation the ibm future systems project and data general fountainhead processor were examples of this those systems were never produced but elements of the ibm project were implemented in the system three eight and as four zero zero which used extensive microprogramming to implement high level constructs for example the system three eight and as four zero zero could perform a relational sql join in a machine instruction microprogramming also helped alleviate the memory bandwidth problem during the one nine seven zero s cpu speeds grew more quickly than memory speeds numerous acceleration techniques such as memory block transfer memory pre fetch and multi level caches helped reduce this however high level machine instructions made possible by microcode helped further fewer more complex machine instructions require less memory bandwidth for example complete operations on character strings could be done as a single machine instruction thus avoiding multiple instruction fetches architectures using this approach included the ibm system three six zero and dec vax family used complex microprograms the ibm system three eight and as four zero zero too this concept even further the approach of using increasingly complex microcode implemented instruction sets was later called cisc other benefits a processor s microprograms operate on a more primitive totally different and much more hardware oriented architecture than the assembly instructions visible to normal programmers in coordination with the hardware the microcode implements the programmer visible architecture the underlying hardware need not have a fixed relationship to the visible architecture this makes it possible to implement a given instruction set architecture on a wide variety of underlying hardware micro architectures doing so is important if binary program compatibility is a priority that way previously existing programs can run on totally new hardware without requiring revision and recompilation however there may be a performance penalty for this approach the tradeoffs between application backward compatibility vs cpu performance are hotly debated by cpu design engineers the ibm system three six zero has a three two bit architecture with one six general purpose registers but most of the system three six zero implementations actually used hardware implementing a much simpler underlying microarchitecture the three six zero model three zero the slowest model in the line used an eight bit microarchitecture with only a few hardware registers everything that the programmer saw was emulated by the microprogram other faster models used one six bit or three two bit underlying microarchitectures that more closely resembled the programmer visible architecture this allowed much faster execution speeds in this way microprogramming enabled ibm to design many system three six zero models with substantially different hardware and spanning a wide range of cost and performance while making them all architecturally compatible this dramatically reduced the amount of unique system software that had to be written for each model a similar approach was used by digital equipment corporation in their vax family of computers initially a three two bit amd two nine zero one bit sliced processor in conjunction with supporting microcode implemented the programmer visible architecture later vax versions used different microarchitectures yet the programmer visible architecture didn t change microprogramming also reduced the cost of field changes to correct defects bugs in the processor a bug could often be fixed by replacing a portion of the microprogram rather than by changes being made to hardware logic and wiring history before one nine five one the control logic for central processing units was designed by ad hoc methods one of the simplest was to use rings of flip flops to sequence the computer s control logic in one nine five one maurice wilkes had a fundamental insight he realized that if one takes the control signals for a computer one could understand them as being played much like a player piano roll that is they are controlled by a sequence of very wide words constructed of bits implementation a microprogram provides the bits to control these the fundamental advance is that cpu control becomes a specialized form of a computer program it thus transforms a complex electronic design challenge the control of a cpu into a less complex programming challenge to take advantage of this computers were divided into several parts a microsequencer picked the next word of the control store a sequencer is mostly a counter but usually also has some way to jump to a different part of the control store depending on some data usually data from the instruction register and always some part of the control store the simplest sequencer is just a register loaded from a few bits of the control store a register set is a fast memory containing the data of the central processing unit it may include the program counter stack pointer and other numbers that are not easily accessible to the application programmer often the register set is triple ported that is two registers can be read and a third written at the same time an arithmetic and logic unit performs calculations usually addition logical negation a right shift and logical and it often performs other functions as well there may also be a memory address register and a memory data register used to access the main computer storage together these elements form an execution unit most modern cpus have several execution units even simple computers usually have one unit to read and write memory and another to execute user code these elements could often be bought together as a single chip this chip came in a fixed width which would form a slice through the execution unit these were known a bit slice chips the parts of the execution units and the execution units themselves are interconnected by a bundle of wires called a bus programmers develop microprograms the basic tools are software a microassembler allows a programmer to define the table of bits symbolically a simulator program executes the bits in the same way as the electronics hopefully and allows much more freedom to debug the microprogram a typical micromachine s control word has a field a range of bits to control each piece of electronics in the cpu for example one simple arrangement might be register source a register source b destination register arithmetic and logic unit operation type of jump jump address for this type of micromachine to implement a jump instruction with the address following the jump op code the microassembly would look something like any line starting with a number sign is a comment this is just a label the ordinary way assemblers symbolically represent a memory address instructionjump to prepare for the next instruction the instruction decode microcode has already moved the program counter to the memory address register this instruction fetches the target address of the jump instruction from the memory word following the jump opcode by copying from the memory data register to the memory address register this gives the memory system two clock ticks to fetch the next instruction to the memory data register for use by the instruction decode the sequencer instruction next means just add one to the control word address mdr none mar copy next none this places the address of the next instruction into the pc this gives the memory system a clock tick to finish the fetch started on the previous microinstruction the sequencer instruction is to jump to the start of the instruction decode mar one pc add jmp instructiondecode the instruction decode is not shown because it s usually a mess very particular to the exact processor being emulated even this example is simplified many cpus have several ways to calculate the address rather than just fetching it from the word following the op code therefore rather than just one jump instruction those cpus have a family of related jump instructions the above is an example of horizontal microcode this is microcode that sets all the bits of the cpu s controls on each tick of the clock that drives the sequencer note how many of the bits in horizontal microcode contain fields to do nothing some cpus use a completely different design called vertical microcode to reduce cost some vertical microcodes are just the assembly language of a simple conventional computer that is emulating a more complex computer this technique was popular in the time of the pdp eight another form of vertical microcode has two fields field select field value the field select selects which part of the cpu will be controlled by this word of the control store the field value actually controls that part of the cpu with this type of microcode a designer explicitly chooses to make a slower cpu to save money by reducing the unused bits in the control store however the reduced complexity may increase the cpu s clock frequency which lessens the effect of an increased number of cycles per instruction because transistors are becoming cheaper horizontal microcode is coming to dominate the design of hardware control units as of the early two zero zero zero s cpus no longer use vertical microcode except perhaps in emulator software designed to run on a standard computer after the microprogram is finalized and extensively tested it is sometimes used as the input to a computer program that constructs logic to produce the same data this program is similar to those used to optimize a programmable logic array no known computer program can produce optimal logic but even pretty good logic can vastly reduce the number of transistors from the number required for a rom control store this reduces the cost and power used by a cpu writable control stores a few computers were built using writable microcode rather that storing the microcode in rom or hard wired logic the microcode was stored in a ram called a writable control store or wcs many of these machines were experimental laboratory prototypes but there were also commercial machines that used writable microcode such as early xerox workstations the dec vax eight eight zero zero nautilus family and a number of ibm system three seven zero implementations many more machines offered user programmable writeable control stores as an option including the hp two one zero zero and dec pdp one one six zero minicomputers wcs offered several advantages including the ease of patching the microprogram and for certain hardware generations faster access than roms could provide user programmable wcs allowed the user to optimize the machine for specific purposes a cpu that uses microcode generally takes several clock cycles to execute a single instruction one clock cycle for each step in the microprogram for that instruction some cisc processors include instructions that can take a very long time to execute such variations in instruction length interfere with pipelining and interrupt latency microcode versus vliw and risc many risc and vliw processors are designed to execute every instruction as long as it is in the cache in a single cycle this is very similar to the way cpus with microcode execute one microinstruction per cycle vliw processors have instructions that look like very wide horizontal microcode while risc processors generally have instructions that look more like narrow vertical microcode see also firmware external links writable instruction set computer computer hardware firmware in software engineering multi tier architecture often referred to as n tier architecture is a client server architecture in which an application is executed by more than one distinct software agent for example an application that uses middleware to service data requests between a user and a database employs multi tier architecture the most widespread use of multi tier architecture refers to three tier architecture see also client server three tier computing web application business logic rich internet application software engineering software architecture this proposal has become accepted and is superseded by wikipedia wikiproject and wikipedia wikiproject best practices this page is kept for historic purposes only this proposal was originally written by manning bartlett this is a proposal for all and sundry to read and consider because of its length i chose not to include it in the general suggestions page although i have placed a link there n b which page is this if you feel this belongs somewhere else please feel free to move it my field of professional expertise is metadata management that is the information about the information i have spent the past few days pondering how to apply this knowledge to the wikipedia i have adapted a concept from this field and tentatively titled it a wikiproject i am defining a project as a comprehensive catalogue of related information entities examples would include countries of the world famous scientists games and sports whatever q v the tree of life already in existence a wikiproject is a metadata page that serves as a reference point for those who wish to be involved in a specific project structural principles defines the scope of the particular project establishes the formatting conventions for individual entries eg how each individual entry should be structured in a biographical entry relevant dates notable achievements etc establishes the formatting conventions for hierarchical descendants eg guidelines on how to define prime ministers of new zealand as a descendant of prime minister as a descendant of political leader optional define minimum standards a wikiproject can lay down the principles by which an individual entry can be considered to have achieved minimum standard of completion eg wikiproject countries of the world may require capital imports exports major cities poopulation political history etc etc whatever both the standards and the accreditation maintain their dynamic status so we are not getting into locking pages or other methods which contradict the essential nature of the wikipedia lists participating contributors provides subject specific forums note such pages already exist in an ad hoc sense eg tree of life however my concept for a wikiproject page seeks to standardise and formalise this approach also it seeks to segregate the information from the management of the information advantages standardisation of look and feel there are existing page that deal with standardisation but they cannot be applied generically the conventions for entries on mathematics or chemistry are worlds apart from the conventions for famous authors even a generic standard for biographical entries cannot be applied universally the method of describing egyptian pharoahs would be radically different to pages for american baseball players pharoahs don t have rbi statistics decreases the volume of redirects due to there being a consistent and well defined hierarchical descendant schema allows the development of special interest communities within the wikipedia this has already happened of course but the wikiproject page formalises the process permits strategic planning and consensual discussion by centralising the talk forums to predictable locations we minimise the fragmentation of discussion into multiple locations which occurs presently allows controlled dynamic evolution the inherent problem in any communal project is that without central authority chaos emerges but with excessive central authority stagnation sets in the wikiproject is a central authority thus providing the benefits of stability but the wikiproject page itself remains consensual and dynamic where evolution occurs the process can be centrally managed a convention for information management participants in the overall wikipedia will have a convention defined for creating new projects and they will know where to go to find existing framework definitions and discussion forums for the framework a resource for standards and comprehensiveness numerous attempts have been made to document what has not been achieved and give suggestions for areas needing attention this merely formalises the process provides a forum for endorsement without closing off editorial freedom each wikiproject can evolve a definition of minimum required standard as entries achieve this status they can be documented on the wikiproject page dissenters can always remove the status or upgrade the entry in question what a wikiproject is not a wikiproject is not a place for subject information it is a place for the management of entries within a specific subject area neither is it rigids in its hierarchical management all hierarchies are arbitrary the wikipedia seeks to create one purely for the management of entry creation not as a schema of knowledge is it worth the effort the value of such a metadata management model increases with the volume of contributors in a case where only a handful of contributors are working on a project the actual value of a wikiproject page is negative it only adds additional work however as the volume of contributors increases the work required to maintain the wikiproject pages is substantially less than the work required to correct the fragmentation of style and content and the duplication which will otherwise occur have you ever spent an hour tracking down and editing redirects a sample wikiproject page is laid out below for consideration example title wikiproject musical instruments scope this wikiproject aims to catalogue all known musical instruments parentage this wikiproject is a child wikiproject of music descendant wikiprojects no descendant wikiprojects defined formatting discussion of how each musical instrument entry is to be formatted sample given including eg name alternate names description evolution relatives see also etc talk section related to formatting hierarchy definition instruments can be placed into one or more of the following categories orchestral brass wind stringed ethnic notice the categories are not mutually exclusive a trumpet is both brass and orchestral and belongs in both talk section related to hierarchy definition directory of participants general strategy and discussion forum notes notice that in the example the structural definitions are as fluid as everything else the natural evolution of proposal consensual discussion consolidation will occur as the discussions about structure die down the suggestion becomes the convention anyway this is just a proposal and i am keen to hear feedback from any and all as this is the wikipedia i am aware that i am free to commence this wikiproject idea anyway however if people are warm to the idea it would be nice to plan and consult as we lay down the framework myrinet ansi vita two six one nine nine eight is a high speed local area networking system designed by myricom to be used as an interconnect between multiple machines to form computer clusters myrinet has much less protocol overhead than standards such as ethernet and therefore provides better throughput less interference and less latency while using the host cpu although it can be used as a traditional networking system myrinet is often used directly by programs that know about it thereby bypassing a call into the operating system myrinet physically consists of two fibre optic cables upstream and downstream connected to the host computers with a single connector machines are connected via low overhead routers and switches as opposed to connecting one machine directly to another myrinet includes a number of fault tolerance features mostly backed by the switches these include flow control error control and heartbeat monitoring on every link the first generation provided five one two mbit s data rates in both directions and later versions supported one two eight gbit s and two gbit s newest fourth generation myrinet supports one zero gbit s data rate and is interoperable with one zero gigabit ethernet on phy the physical layer cables connectors distances signaling according to myricom fourth generation myrinet products are expected to start to ship in september two zero zero five myrinet s throughput is close to the theoretical maximum of the physical layer on the latest two zero gbit s links myrinet often runs at one nine eight gbit s of sustained throughput considerably better than what ethernet offers which varies from zero six and one nine gbit s depending on load however for supercomputing the low latency of myrinet is even more important than its throughput performance since according to amdahl s law a high performance parallel system tends to be bottlenecked by its slowest sequential process which is often the latency of transmission of messages across the network in all but the most embarrassingly parallel supercomputer workloads according to myricom one four

it is the opposite of traditional composing known to some as musique abstraite literally abstract music as the sounds are recorded first then built into a tune as opposed to a tune being written then given to players to turn into sound concr te was pioneered in the late one nine four zero s and one nine five zero s spurred by developments in technology most prominently microphones and the commercial availability of the magnetic tape recorder utilized as tape loops pierre schaeffer a paris radio broadcaster created some of the earliest pieces of musique concr te including tude aux chemins de fer study with trains tude au piano i piano study i and tude aux casseroles study with baking pans each of these pieces involved speeding up looping and reversing recordings of sound sources like trains piano and rattling cookware schaeffer also collaborated with another musique concr te pioneer pierre henry together they created pieces such as symphonie pour un homme seul symphony for a man alone concr te was combined with other synthesized forms of electronic music to create edgar var se s po me lectronique po me was played at the one nine five eight brussels belgium world s fair through four two five carefully placed loudspeakers in a special pavilion designed by iannis xenakis the fictitious twelve tone composeress dame hilda tablet created by henry reed spoke of her creation of musique concr te renforc e after the one nine five zero s concr te was somewhat displaced by other forms of electronic composition although its influence can be seen in popular music by many bands including the beatles in their song revolution nine and pink floyd notably the finale of the song bike around one nine six seven and one nine six eight frank zappa made several musique concrete pieces with the help of the apostolic vlorch injector at apostolic studios in new york city the resulting sound as heard on the chrome plated megaphone of destiny and dwarf nebula processional march is a series of bizarre swirling buzzes beeps and whooshes traditional and non traditional concr te experienced a revival in the one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s artists like ray buttigieg with his experimental series earth noise and sound science series and john oswald s plunderphonics use found and intended sounds in old and cutting edge techniques although modern sampling technology is now often used in place of magnetic tape recently the growing popularity in all forms of electronica has led to a re birth of musique concr te artists such as christian fennesz francisco lopez ernesto rodrigues and scanner use many concr te techniques in their music while often being classified under more common electronica genres such as idm or downtempo music magazines such as the wire regularly feature articles and reviews of musique concr te external links essay electronic music genres sampling in mathematics a metric space is a set where a notion of distance between elements of the set is defined the metric space which most closely corresponds to our intuitive understanding of space is the three dimensional euclidean space the euclidean metric of this space defines the distance between two points as the length of the straight line connecting them the geometry of the space depends on the metric chosen and by using a different metric we can construct interesting non euclidean geometries such as those used in the theory of general relativity a metric space induces topological properties like open and closed sets which leads to the study of even more abstract topological spaces history maurice fr chet introduced metric spaces in his work sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel rendic circ mat palermo two two one nine zero six one seven four definition a metric space is a two tuple x d where x is a set and d is a metric on x that is a function d x x r such that d x y zero non negativity d x y zero if and only if x y identity of indiscernibles d x y d y x symmetry d x z d x y d y z triangle inequality the function d is also called distance function or simply distance often d is omitted and one just writes x for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is used examples the real numbers with the distance function d x y y x given by the absolute value and more generally euclidean n space with the euclidean distance are complete metric spaces hyperbolic plane any normed vector space is a metric space by defining d x y y x see also distances based on norms if such a space is complete we call it a banach space example the manhattan norm gives rise to the manhattan distance where the distance between any two points or vectors is the sum of the distances between corresponding coordinates the discrete metric where d x y one for all x not equal to y and d x y zero otherwise is a simple but important example and can be applied to all sets the british rail metric also called the post office metric on a normed vector space given by d x y x y for distinct points x and y and d x x zero the name alludes to the tendency of railway journeys or letters to proceed via london which is identified with the origin the chessboard distance the number of moves a chess king would take to travel from x to y if x is some set and m is a metric space then the set of all bounded functions f x m i e those functions whose image is a bounded subset of m can be turned into a metric space by defining d f g sup x in x d f x g x for any bounded functions f and g if m is complete then this space is complete as well the levenshtein distance also called character edit distance is a measure of the similarity between two strings u and v the distance is the minimal number of deletions insertions or substitutions required to transform u into v if x is a topological or metric space and m is a metric space then the set of all bounded continuous functions from x to m forms a metric space if we define the metric as above d f g sup x in x d f x g x for any bounded continuous functions f and g if m is complete then this space is complete as well if m is a connected riemannian manifold then we can turn m into a metric space by defining the distance of two points as the infimum of the lengths of the paths continuously differentiable curves connecting them if g is an undirected connected graph then the set v of vertices of g can be turned into a metric space by defining d x y to be the length of the shortest path connecting the vertices x and y similarly apart from mathematical details for any system of roads and terrains the distance between two locations can be defined as the length of the shortest route to be a metric there should not be one way roads examples include some mentioned above the manhattan norm the british rail metric and the chessboard distance more generally for any system of roads and terrains with given maximum possible speed at any location the distance between two locations can be defined as the time the fastest route takes to be a metric there should not be one way roads and the maximum speed should not depend on direction similarly in three d the metrics on the surface of a polyhedron include the ordinary metric and the distance over the surface a third metric on the edges of a polyhedron is one where the paths are the edges for example the distance between opposite vertices of a unit cube is three five and three respectively if m is a metric space we can turn the set k m of all compact subsets of m into a metric space by defining the hausdorff distance d x y inf then d x s zero if and only if x belongs to the closure of s furthermore we have the following generalization of the triangle inequality d x s d x y d y s which in particular shows that the map x mapsto d x s is continuous equivalence of metric spaces comparing two metric spaces one can distinguish various degrees of equivalence to preserve at least the topological structure induced by the metric these require at least the existence of a continuous function between them morphism preserving the topology of the metric spaces given two metric spaces m one d one and m two d two they are called topologically isomorphic or homeomorphic if there exists a homeomorphism between them they are called uniformly isomorphic if there exists a uniform isomorphism between them they are called isometrically isomorphic if there exists a bijective isometry between them in this case the two spaces are essentially identical an isometry is a function f m one m two which preserves distances d two f x f y d one x y for all x y in m one isometries are necessarily injective they are called similar if there exists a positive constant k zero and a bijective function f called similarity such that f m one m two and d two f x f y k d one x y for all x y in m one they are called similar of the second type if there exists a bijective function f called similarity such that f m one m two and d two f x f y d two f u f v if and only if d one x y d one u v for all x y u v in m one in case of euclidean space with usual metric the two notions of similarity are equivalent quotient metric space if m is a metric space with metric d and is an equivalence relation on m then we can endow the quotient set m with the following pseudo metric given two equivalence classes x and y we define d x y inf q where the infimum is taken over all finite sequences p one p two dots p n and q one q two dots q n with p one x q n y q i p i one two dots n one in general this will only define a pseudometric i e d x y zero does not necessarily imply that x y however for nice equivalence relations e g those given by gluing together polyhedra along faces it is a metric moreover if m is a compact space then the induced topology on m is the quotient topology the quotient metric d is characterized by the following universal property if f m d longrightarrow x delta is a short map between metric spaces that is delta f x f y le d x y for all x y satisfying f x f y whenever x sim y then the induced function overline m sim longrightarrow x given by overline x

is the scientific study of the plants animals and other organisms that live in the ocean given that in biology many phyla families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy there are many practical reasons to study marine biology marine life represents a vast resource providing food medicine and raw materials in addition to helping to support recreation and tourism all over the world at a fundamental level marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet marine organisms produce much of the oxygen we breathe and probably help regulate the earth s climate shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life and some marine organisms even help create new land the ocean is vast and contains many strange and wonderful creatures overview marine biology covers a great deal from the microscopic including plankton and phytoplankton which can be as small as zero zero two micrometers and are both hugely important as the primary producers of the sea to the huge cetaceans whales which reach up to a reported three three meters one zero nine feet in length the habitats studied by marine biology include everything from the tiny layers of surface water in which organisms and abiotic items may be trapped in surface tension between the ocean and atmosphere to the depths of the abyssal trenches sometimes one zero zero zero zero meters or more beneath the surface of the ocean it studies habitats such as coral reefs kelp forests tidepools muddy sandy and rocky bottoms and the open ocean pelagic zone where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary a large proportion of all life on earth exists in the oceans exactly how large is the proportion is still unknown while the oceans comprise about seven one of the earth s surface due to their depth they encompass about three zero zero times the habitable volume of the terrestrial habitats on earth many species are economically important to humans including the food fishes it is also becoming understood that the well being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways human understanding is growing of the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles such as that of matter such as the carbon cycle of air such as earth s respiration and movement of energy through ecosystems large areas beneath the ocean surface still remain effectively unexplored subfields the marine ecosystem is large and thus there are many subfields of marine biology most involve studying specializations of particular species other subfields study the physical effects of continual immersion in sea water and the ocean in general adaptation to a salty environment and the affects of changing various oceanic properties on marine life a subfield of marine biology studies the relationships between oceans and ocean life and global weather and environmental issues such as carbon dioxide displacement recent marine biotechnology has focused largely on marine biomolecules especially proteins that may have uses in medicine or engineering an interesting branch of marine biology is aquaculture marine environments are the home to many exotic biological materials that may inspire biomimetic materials related fields marine biology is closely linked to both oceanography and biology it also encompasses ideas from ecology fisheries science and marine conservation can be considered partial offshoots of marine biology lifeforms microscopic life microscopic life undersea is incredibly varied and still poorly understood for example the role of viruses in marine ecosystems is barely being explored even in the beginning of the two one st century the role of phytoplankton is better understood due to their critical position as the most numerous primary producers on earth phytoplankton are categorized into cyanobacteria also called blue green algae bacteria various types of algae red green brown and yellow green diatoms dinoflagellates euglenoids coccolithophorids cryptomonads crysomonads chloromonads prasinomonads and silicoflagellates zooplankton tend to be somewhat larger and not all are microscopic many protozoa are zooplankton including dinoflagellates zooflagellates foraminiferans and radiolarians some of these such as dinoflaggelates are also phytoplankton the plant animal distinction often breaks down in very small organisms other zooplankton include cnidarians ctenophores chaetognaths molluscs arthropods urochordates and annelids such as polychaetes many larger animals begin their life as zooplankton before they become large enough to take their familiar forms two examples are fish larvae and sea stars also called starfish plant life plant life is relatively rare undersea most of the niche occupied by plants on land is actually occupied by macroscopic algae in the ocean such as sargassum and kelp the plants that do survive in the sea are often found in shallow waters such as the seagrasses examples of which are eelgrass zostera and turtlegrass thalassia the intertidal zone is also a good place to find plant life in the sea where mangroves or cordgrass might grow other sea life other sea life includes cnidaria such as jellyfish and sea anemone ctenophora sea worms including phyla plathyhelminthes nemertea annelida sipuncula echiura and the phoronida mollusca including shellfish squid octopus crustaceans porifera including sponges bryozoa echinodermata including starfish and urochordata sea squirts or tunicates fish main article fish fishes inhabit the largest by volume biome on earth they have evolved very different biological functions from other large organisms fish anatomy includes a two chamber heart operculum secretory cells that produce mucous swim bladder scales fins lips and eyes fish breathe by extracting oxygen from water through their gills fins propel and stabilize the fish in the water well known fish include sardines anchovy tuna clownfish also known as anemonefish and bottom fish which include halibut and ling cod predators include sharks and barracuda marine mammals main article marine mammal there are five main types of marine mammals cetaceans include toothed whales suborder odontoceti such as the sperm whale dolphins and porpoises cetaceans also include baleen whales suborder mysticeti such as gray whales humpback whales dall s porpoise and blue whales sirenians include manatees the dugong and the extinct steller s sea cow seals family phocidae sea lions family otariidae which also include the fur seals and the walrus family odobenidae are all considered pinnipeds sea otters are members of the family mustelidae which includes weasels and badgers finally polar bears family ursidae are sometimes considered marine mammals because of their dependence on the sea reefs reefs comprise some of the densest and most diverse habitats in the world the best known types of reefs are tropical coral reefs which exist in most tropical waters however reefs can also exist in cold water reefs are built up by corals and other calcium depositing animals usually on top of a rocky outcrop on the ocean floor reefs can also grow on other surfaces which has made it possible to create artificial reefs coral reefs also support a huge community of life including the corals themselves their symbiotic zooxanthellae tropical fish and many other organisms much attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the el ni o weather phenomenon in one nine nine eight coral reefs experienced a once in a thousand years bleaching event in which vast expanses of reefs across the earth died because sea surface temperatures rose well above normal some reefs are recovering but scientists say that five eight of the world s coral reefs are now endangered and predict that global warming could exacerbate this trend deep sea and trenches the ocean is deep very deep in some places the deepest recorded measure to date is the mariana trench near the philippines in the pacific ocean at one zero nine two four m three five eight three eight ft at such depths water pressure is extreme and there is no sunlight but some life still exists small flounder family soleidae fish and shrimp were seen by the american crew of the bathyscaphe trieste when it dove to the bottom in one nine six zero other notable deeps include monterey canyon in the eastern pacific the tonga trench in the southwest at one zero eight eight two m three five seven zero two feet the philippine trench the puerto rico trench at eight six zero five m two eight two three two ft the romanche trench at seven seven six zero m two four four five zero ft fram basin in the arctic ocean at four six six five m one five three zero five ft the java trench at seven four five zero m two four four four two ft and the south sandwich trench at seven two three five m two three seven three seven ft in general the deep sea is considered to start at the photic zone the point where sunlight loses its power of transference through the water many life forms that live at these depths have the ability to create their own light much life centers around seamounts that rise from the deeps where fish and other sea life congregate to spawn and feed hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor act as oases as do their opposites cold seeps these places support unique biomes and many new microbes have been discovered at there marine biologists are trying to amass a more complete mapping of underwater species with the help of modern techniques the deepest oceanic depressions are supposed to contain unknown species possibly also of great potential interest for the theories on evolution how oceanic factors affect distribution of various organisms an active research topic in marine biology is to discover and map the life cycles of various species and where they spend their time marine biologists study how the ocean currents tides and many other oceanic factors affect ocean lifeforms including their growth distribution and well being this has only recently become technically feasible with advances in gps and newer underwater visual devices most ocean life breeds in specific places nests or not in others spends time as juveniles in still others and in maturity in yet others scientists know little about where many species spent different parts of their life cycles for example it is still largely unknown where sea

information network for britain and ireland marlin marine biology graphical overview of a microkernel a microkernel is a type of kernel which consists of a simple abstraction over the hardware with a set of primitives or system calls to implement minimal os services such as address space management thread management and inter process communication all other services those normally provided by the kernel such as networking are implemented in user space programs referred to as servers one of the key concepts in the unix operating system is the use of a large number of small programs that can be strung together to complete a task instead of a large text manipulation program for instance unix users can pipe the source text file through a series of single purpose utility programs to achieve the same end although the results are the same the unix model allows for considerably more flexibility the user can add or remove parts of the pipeline using existing commands for launching programs it also makes development much easier as each program is small and dedicated to a single role making it much easier to understand and debug under unix the operating system consists of many of these utilities along with the master control program the kernel the kernel s job is to schedule execution of the rest of the programs on the system as well as control all hardware to avoid problems if two programs attempt to access the same device at the same time in order to mediate such access the kernel was given special rights on the system running in supervisor mode although it was a program like any other the extra privileges led to the concept of programs running in user space and kernel space originally the kernel was fairly small but as the capability of computers grew the number of devices the kernel had to control also grew many of these no longer fit into a model based on files for instance networking can t be effectively treated as a file more and more code was included into the kernel to handle these sorts of tasks and the kernels grew modern unix systems are extremely large the linux kernel for example consists of six million lines of code microkernels were an attempt to break out of the ever growing kernels and return to a system in which most tasks would be completed by stringing together a series of smaller operations the key problem under unix had been trying to model the entire world as files which no longer seemed to apply instead the microkernels took a step back and considered pipes as a specific example of a much more general concept inter process communications or ipc ipc could be used to emulate unix style pipes but it could also be used for practically any other task passing data at high speed between programs with ipc the operating system could once again be built up of a number of small programs networking could be removed from the kernel and placed in a separate user space program which would be called by other programs on the system all hardware support would be handled in this fashion with programs for networking file systems graphics etc servers are programs like any others allowing the operating system to be modified simply by starting and stopping programs for a small machine without networking support for instance the networking server simply isn t started under a traditional system this would require the kernel to be recompiled something well beyond the capabilities of the average end user in theory the system is also more stable because a failing server simply stops a single program rather than causing the kernel itself to crash however part of the system state is lost with the failing server and it is generally difficult to continue execution of applications or even of other servers with a fresh copy for example if a theoretic server responsible for tcp ip connections is restarted applications could be told the connection was lost and reconnect going through the new instance of the server however other system objects like files do not have these convenient semantics are supposed to be reliable not become unavailable randomly and keep all the information written to them previously so database techniques like transactions replication and checkpointing need to be used between servers in order to preserve essential state across single server restarts the system would look as if it had a full unix kernel the fact that the networking support was being handed off would be invisible that system would be considerably easier to maintain instead of a single six million line kernel there would be a series of smaller programs instead additionally users could choose capabilities as needed and run only those programs tailoring the system to their needs the same sort of changes to a traditional kernel also known as a monolithic kernel or monokernel are very difficult due to the high level of interconnectedness between parts of the system the role of the kernel in such a system is limited in addition to providing basic task management starting and stopping other programs it would have to provide the ipc system and provide security when booting the kernel would start up a series of servers to handle the hardware on the system granting those servers additional rights as needed new programs those being started by the user would use the ipc system to access hardware calling the kernel to pass along messages after being checked for rights and validity to handle these tasks mach included the concept of ports which introduced filesystem like endpoints into the ipc system complete with rights for other programs to use them for instance a network server would hold the write permissions to the networking hardware and keep a number of ports open for reading to allow other programs to call it other programs could not take over the networking hardware without the kernel specifically granting this access and only after the networking server agreed to give up those rights the collection of servers model offered many advantages over traditional operating systems by placing the majority of code in well separated programs development on such a system was considerably easier developing new networking stacks on a traditional monolithic kernel required the entire kernel to be recompiled and rebooted hard crashing the machine if there was a bug with a microkernel there was little chance that an updated networking system would do anything other than inconvenience the user and require that one program to be relaunched it also offered considerably more security and stability for the same reasons additionally the kernel itself was much smaller later versions of mach were only four four zero zero zero lines of code microkernels generally underperform traditional designs sometimes dramatically this is due in large part to the overhead of moving in and out of the kernel a context switch in order to move data between the various applications and servers it was originally believed that careful tuning could reduce this overhead dramatically but by the mid nine zero s most researchers had given up in more recent times newer microkernels designed for performance first have addressed these problems to a very large degree nevertheless the market for existing operating systems is so entrenched that little work continues on microkernel design examples

the sails this is in contrast to monohulls which typically use a keel and or ballast for this purpose multihulls include proas which have two differently sized hulls catamarans which have two similar hulls and trimarans which have a larger hull in the center and two smaller ones on either side multihull sailboats are typically much wider than the equivalent monohull which allows them to carry no ballast so they are typically faster than monohulls under equivalent conditions see nathanael herreshoff s amarylis also one nine eight eight america s cup it also means that multihulls are less prone to sink than monohulls when their hulls are compromised there are also multihull powerboats both for racing and transportation did you know the catamaran is also known as a multihull and also comes in a power flavor with no sailing apparatus in fact pure power catamarans are now becoming a common sight in international charter fleets in the caribbean and mediterranean further a new breed of catamarans has now started to take shape in the form of the mega or super catamaran this defination is reserved for those catamarans over six zero feet in length it usually takes one year to build these huge vessels and often a large amount of customization takes place at the request of the owner who commissions the vessel the birth of these two designs is now being reported widely on sites such as www catamarans com and www two hulls com pros multihulls are substantially faster than monohulls because the absence of ballast reduces their weight and the amount of drag through the water considerably without reducing the amount of sail that they can carry and because the waterline to width ratio is so large their thin hulls can be driven through the water a higher speeds popularity multihulls are quite popular for racing especially in europe and australia and are somewhat popular for cruising in the caribbean they re not seen very often in the united states although they re gradually getting more popular until the one nine eight zero s most multihull sailboats except for beach cats were built either by their owners or by boatbuilders on a semi custom basis since then several companies have been successful selling mass produced by boat industry standards boats issues with multihulls multihulls width is often an issue especially when docking they are also more expensive to produce than a monohull of the same length unfortunately it is common wisdom among monohull sailors at least that in the open ocean multihull craft are unsafe if a storm or wave capsizes a small monohull it may recover if it does not broach and sink the rigging will probably be severely damaged but the crew will be able to jury rig and reach a port multihulls can capsize but they rarely sink even most rescued crews in races have reported that they were unable to dismount the deck mounted liferaft or emergency radio from the mass of broken submerged rigging under the capsized craft another risk in a multihull is the pitch pole when the bow of the boat buries itself into a wave and the stern flips over putting the boat into a forward somersault this tends to be more common in smaller racing multihulls which carry huge amounts of sail in relation to their weight this rarely effects monohull s because they carry more ballast which prevents the tendency to flip and helps them power through waves proponents argue that no careful captain ever finds himself in capsizing conditions most crews that have capsized in the open ocean found it an extremely traumatic event no matter what type of boat they sailed proponents also argue that capsize is only one of many types of catastrophe that can befall yachts at sea in other types for example hull compromise by hitting submerged debris multihulls are substantially safer than monohulls because they don t carry ballast and can therefore float even when severely damaged popular multihulls there are many types of multihulls in different categories among the small sailing catamarans also called beach catamarans the most recognized racing classes are the hobie cat one six formula one eight cats a cats and the olympic multihull called tornado larger boats include corsair marine mid sized trimarans and privilege large luxurious catamarans the largest manufacturer of large multihulls in fountaine pajot in france but also the much larger french trimarans of the orma racing cirquit and round the world record attemps are included in this in the powerboat part of the multihull spectrum we find a range of boats from small single pilot formula one power boat series to the large multi engined or even gas turbined power boats that are used in the off shore powerboat racing series and that are piloted by

operating system made by microsoft it was the most widely used member of the dos family of operating systems it was the dominant operating system for the pc compatible platform during the one nine eight zero s it has gradually been replaced on consumer desktop computers with various generations of the windows operating system ms dos was originally released in one nine eight one and had eight major versions released before microsoft stopped development in two zero zero zero it was the key product in microsoft s growth from a programming languages company to a diverse software development firm providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources history ms dos was created by computer manufacturer seattle computer products scp in one nine eight zero as qdos for quick and dirty operating system but was renamed eight six dos because it was designed to run on the intel eight zero eight six processor in a sequence of events that would later inspire much folklore microsoft licensed qdos to ibm on behalf of scp microsoft acquired the system for only five zero zero zero zero from scp shortly before the pc s release development original ms dos advertisement ibm and microsoft both released versions of dos the ibm version was supplied with the ibm pc and known as pc dos originally ibm only validated and packaged microsoft developments and thus ibm s versions tended to be released shortly after microsoft s however ms dos four zero was actually based on ibm pc dos four zero as microsoft was by then concentrating on os two development microsoft released its versions under the name ms dos while ibm released its versions under the name pc dos initially when microsoft would license their oem version of ms dos the computer manufacturer would customize its name i e tandydos compaq dos etc most of these versions were identical to the official ms dos however microsoft began to insist that oems start calling the product ms dos eventually only ibm resisted this move computer advertisements of this period often claimed that computers were ibm compatible or very rarely ms dos compatible the two terms were not synonyms there were computers which used ms dos which could not run all the software that an ibm compatible machine could an example is the pivot which used ms dos but was not ibm compatible programs written specifically for ibm compatibles could run faster by bypassing slow ms dos functions e g by writing video information directly to the area of memory assigned to it pc dos one zero august one nine eight one initial release with the first ibm pc pc dos one one may one nine eight two ms dos one two five may one nine eight two first release for non ibm hardware ms dos two zero march one nine eight three introduced features from unix such as subdirectories handle based file operations command input output redirection and pipes microsoft decided to use backslashes as pathname separators rather than slashes as on unix apparently due to the latter character being used as the switch character in most dos and cp m programs adds support for hard drives and three six zero kb floppy disks pc dos two one october one nine eight three ms dos two one one march one nine eight four ms dos three zero august one nine eight four adds support for one two mb floppy disks and larger hard disks ms dos three one november one nine eight four ms dos three two january one nine eight six supported two hard disk partitions of up to three two mb one primary and one logical drive in an extended partition pc dos three three april one nine eight seven ms dos three three august one nine eight seven supported multiple logical drives ms dos four zero june one nine eight eight actually derived from ibm s codebase rather than the reverse pc dos four zero july one nine eight eight added dos shell the company lost another lawsuit resulting from code in windows three one which caused spurious errors when windows was launched on dr dos see the dr dos article for more on this and embrace extend and extinguish for more on microsoft s anti competitive maneuvers prior to one nine nine five microsoft licensed ms dos to computer manufacturers under three types of agreement per processor a fee for each system the company sold per system a fee for each system of a particular model or per copy a fee for each copy of ms dos installed the largest manufacturers used the per processor arrangement which had the lowest fee this arrangement made it expensive for the large manufacturers to migrate to any other operating system such as dr dos in one nine nine four the us government charged microsoft with violations of antitrust law and a settlement agreement limited microsoft to per system licensing digital research did not gain by this settlement and years later its successor in interest caldera sued microsoft for damages this lawsuit was settled with a monetary payment of one five zero million dollars multitasking ms dos was not designed to be a multi user or multitasking operating system but many attempts were made to retrofit these capabilities the terminate and stay resident tsr system call originally targeted at loadable device drivers and other mostly undocumented functions were used to create pop up applications although it used them itself microsoft discouraged use and sometimes denied the existence of these undocumented functions but as many classes of co resident software required these features developers were forced to disassemble ms dos to create their products borland s sidekick personal productivity product was a notable specimen add on environments like topview and especially desqview attempted to provide multitasking and achieved some success when later combined with the virtual eight zero eight six mode and virtual memory features of the intel eight zero three eight six and later processors windows three eight six two one and subsequent versions provided similar albeit poorer features when running in three eight six enhanced mode but microsoft never specifically marketed this possibility and was mostly interested in converting customers to using gui mode windows applications user interface ms dos employs a command line interface and a batch scripting facility via its command interpreter command com ms dos was designed so users could easily substitute a different command line interpreter for example four dos beginning with version four zero msdos included a file manager program with a quasi graphical user interface the dos shell that featured menus split windows and program shortcuts using character mode graphics that were a primitive imitation of the mac os and windows tips and tricks ms dos is still around to some degree even on windows xp to open an ms dos prompt click run on the start menu here you will type in command without the quotation marks and press enter this invokes the ms dos command processor running under the windows virtual dos machine if you type cmd instead or click on command prompt in the accessories folder in the start menu programs folder you ll get what appears to be an ms dos prompt but actually invokes the windows command processor this is a facility which provides like ms dos s command processor and has similar commands but has no other relationship with the ms dos operating system windows nt command com version bug in windows nt two command shells are in fact present cmd exe and command com the later being the command com taken from ms dos version five zero zero normally running command com from a windows nt cmd shell returns the string microsoft r windows dos and typing ver from a command com shell returns an nt version string like microsoft windows nt version x x xxxx amusingly however a ms dos five zero zero string from command com can be returned by typing the following from any command prompt command c ver which returns ms dos version five zero zero five zero zero this was a case of a more general bug which is that internal commands executed as a resulted of a command c was not redirected to cmd exe ms dos compatibility with other microsoft operating systems after the release of the apple macintosh in one nine eight four ibm personal computer users also desired a graphical user interface many programs running under ms dos tried to fill the void by creating their own graphical interface such as microsoft word for dos xtree and the norton shell however this required duplication of effort and did not provide much consistency in interface design even between product lines non microsoft efforts to provide a consistent interface for example digital research s gem also failed early versions of microsoft windows were ordinary programs that ran on top of ms dos and its clones later versions were launched from dos but extended it by going into protected mode still later versions of ms windows ran independently of dos but included much of the old code such that dos could run in virtual machines under the new os in new computers ms dos cannot run directly if the hard drive uses the ntfs file system which is the recommended file system in windows xp users who wish to access their ntfs formatted hard drive must use a ntfs compatible version of dos related systems several similar products were produced by other companies in the case of pc dos and dr dos it is common but incorrect to call these clones given that microsoft manufactured pc dos for ibm pc dos and ms dos were to continue the genetic analogy identical twins that diverged only in adulthood and eventually became quite different products dr dos was a clone of itself once removed pc dos dr dos novell dos and opendos freedos freedos three two and gnu dos pts dos these products are collectively reffered to

history is the recording in writing or otherwise of the events in the history of humanity that fall within the category of conflict this may range from a melee between two tribes to conflicts between proper militaries to a world war affecting the majority of the human population it differs somewhat from the history of war with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war making while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology governments and geography military activity has been a constant process over thousands of years and the essential tactics strategy and goals of military operations have been unchanging throughout history as an example one notable maneuver is the double envelopment considered to be the consummate military maneuver executed by hannibal in the battle of cannae in two one six bc over two two zero zero years ago this same maneuver was also described by the chinese military theorist sun tzu who wrote at roughly the same time as the founding of rome by the study of history the military seeks to not repeat past mistakes and improve upon its current performance by instilling an ability in commanders to perceive historical parallels during battle so as to capitalize on the lessons learned the main areas military history includes are the history of wars battles and combats history of the military art and history of each specific military service periods of military history early militaries in the earliest societies such as hunter gatherer societies there were no social roles or divisions of labor with the exception of age or sex differences so every able person contributed to any raids or defense of territory only in relatively advanced agricultural societies was there the possibility of professional soldiers or militaries as distinct organized units much of what we know of ancient history is the history of militaries their conquests their movements and their technological innovations there are many reasons for this kingdoms and empires the central units of control in the ancient world could only be maintained through military force due to limited agricultural ability there were relatively few areas that could support large communities so fighting was common weapons and armor designed to be sturdy tended to last longer than other artifacts and thus a great deal of surviving artifacts recovered tend to fall in this category as they are more likely to survive weapons and armor were also mass produced to a scale that makes them quite plentiful throughout history and thus more likely to be found in archaeological digs such items were also considered signs of posterity or virtue and thus were likely to placed in tombs and monuments to prominent warriors and writing when it existed was often used for kings to boast of military conquests or victories writing when used by the common man also tended to record such events as major battles and conquests constituted major events that many would have considered worthy of recording either in an epic such as the homeric writings pertaining to the trojan war or even personal writings indeed the earliest stories center around warfare as war was both a common and dramatic aspect of life the witnessing of a major battle involving many thousands of soldiers would be one that would be quite a spectacle even today and thus considered worthy both of being recorded in song and art but also in realistic histories as well as being a central element in a fictional work lastly as nation states evolved and empires grew the increased need for order and efficiency lead to an increase in the number of records and writings officials and armies would have good reason for keeping detailed records and accounts involving any and all things concerning a matter such as warfare that in the words of sun tzu was a matter of vital importance to the state for all these reasons military history comprises a large part of ancient history notable militaries in the ancient world include egyptian babylonian greek chinese macedonian roman indian gandhara qin some of the military unit types and technologies which were developed in antiquity are infantry cavalry cataphract horse archer war elephant chariotry archer slinger hoplite macedonian phalanx roman legions marius army auxiliaries hastati principes triarii velites medieval militaries main article medieval warfare when stirrups came into use some time during the dark age militaries were forever changed this invention coupled with technological cultural and social developments had forced a dramatic transformation in the character of warfare from antiquity changing military tactics and the role of cavalry and artillery similar patterns of warfare existed in other parts of the world in china around the fifth century armies moved from massed infantry to cavalry based forces copying the steppe nomads the middle east and north africa used similar if often more advanced technologies than europe in japan the medieval warfare period is considered by many to have stretched into the nineteenth century in africa along the sahel and sudan states like the kingdom of sennar and fulani empire employed medieval tactics and weapons well after they had been supplanted in europe some of the military unit types and technologies which were used in the medieval period are artillery cataphract condottieri fyrd horse archer janissary knight see also chivalry english longbow crossbow pikeman samurai sipahi fortification modern militaries in modern times war has evolved from an activity steeped in tradition to a scientific enterprise where success is valued above methods the notion of total war is the extreme of this trend militaries have developed technological advances rivalling the scientific accomplishments of any other field of study however it should be noted that modern militaries benefit in the development of these technologies under the funding of the public the leadership of national governments and often in cooperation with large civilian groups such as the general dynamics and lockheed martin corporations in the united states and as for total war it may be argued that it is not an exclusive practice of modern militaries but in the tradition of genocidal conflict that marks even tribal warfare to this day what distinguishes modern military organizations from those previous is not their willingness to prevail in conflict by any method but rather the technological variety of tools and methods available to modern battlefield commanders from submarines to satellites from knives to nuclear warheads some of the military unit types and technologies which were developed in modern times are ammunition armory conscription grenadier sappers and miners marine aviation musketeer rifleman special forces naval combatant global information grid active electronically scanned array network centric warfare supercomputer space warfare cyberwar reporting of military events gaining an accurate assessment of past military encounters may prove difficult because of bias even in ancient times and systematic propaganda in more modern times descriptions of battles by leaders may be unreliable due to the inclination to minimize mention of failures and exaggerate when boasting of successes further military secrets may prevent some salient facts from being reported at all scholars still do not know the nature of greek fire for instance despite these limitations wars are some of the most studied and detailed periods of human history military historians some of the most notable military historians include thucydides four six zero bc three nine five bc xenophon four three zero

nine five one nine seven zero john keegan one nine three four william ledyard rodgers d one nine four four lynn montross d one nine six one cornelius ryan r ernest conventional warfare involves well identified armed forces fighting one another in a relatively open and straightforward way without weapons of mass destruction unconventional refers to other types of war which can involve raiding guerrilla insurgency and terrorist tactics or alternatively can include nuclear chemical or biological warfare all of these categories usually fall into one of two broader categories high intensity and low intensity warfare high intensity warfare is between two superpowers or large countries fighting for political reasons low intensity warfare involves counterinsurgency guerilla warfare and specialized types of troops fighting revolutionaries see also asymmetrical warfare technological evolution new weapons development can dramatically alter the face of war gettysburg had spectacular casualties in us history because military training was based on historical lessons but long guns had developed more accuracy at a greater distance and the tactics had not evolved at the start of the world wars various nations had developed weapons that were a surprise to their adversaries leading to a need to learn from this and alter how to combat them there were also organizational changes made possible by better training and intercommunication combined arms was the concept of using infantry cavalry and artillery in a coordinated way the romans swiss and others made advances with this which arguably led to them being unbeatable for centuries advances chariot there was human oar power often using slaves built up to ramming speed long before the steam engine there were sailing ships armed with various kinds of cannons galleys were used in the three rd millennium bc by the cretans the greeks then advanced their science the vikings in the eight th century ad invented a ship propelled by oars with a dragon decorating the prow hence called the drakkar as long as there have been fortifications there have been contraptions to break in dating back to the times of romans and earlier subsequent invention of gunpowder dramatically altered this technology english welsh longbow from one two th century it dominated battlefields for over a century in the one zero th century the invention of gunpowder led to many new weapons that got improved over time blackpowder was used in china since the four th century but it was not used as a weapon until the one one th century until mid one five th century guns were held in one hand while the explosive charge was ignited by the other hand then came the matchlock leonardo da vinci made drawings of the wheel lock which made its own sparks at the beginning of the one six th century the first european fire ships were used take a perfectly good ship fill it with flammables set it on fire and send it into enemy lines bayonet is named after bayonne france where it was first manufactured in the one six th century naval mines were invented in the one seven th century though they were not used in great numbers until the american civil war they were used heavily in the second world war today land mines are a major civilian hazard in nations that have had past wars the howitzer arrived in one seven th century to fire high trajectory explosive shells at targets that could not be reached by flat trajectory projectiles the submarine was invented in one six two four balloons were first used in warfare at the end of the one eight th century previously military scouts could only see from high points on the ground or from the mast of a ship now they could be high in the sky signalling to troops on the ground this made it much more difficult for troop movements to go unobserved in the one eight six zero s there were a series of advancements in rifles the first repeating rifle was designed in one eight six zero by a company bought out by winchester which made new and improved versions also in the one eight six zero s came the first boats that would later be known as torpedo boats springfield rifles arrived in the mid one nine th century machine guns arrived in the middle of the one nine th century automatic rifles and light machine guns first arrived at the beginning of the two zero th century the french were the first to introduce the armored car in one nine zero two then in one nine one eight the british produced the first armored troop carrier many early tanks were proof of concept but impractical until further development in one nine one one an aircraft took off from a warship for the first time it was a cruiser take offs were soon perfected but deck landings on a cruiser were another matter this led to the development of an aircraft carrier with a decent unobstructed flight deck chemical warfare exploded into the public consciousness in world war i but may have been used in earlier wars

instrumental piece this time evoking scenes from oldfield s herefordshire country retreat this was followed in one nine seven five with the pioneering world music piece ommadawn and one nine seven eight s incantations which introduced more diverse choral performances from sally oldfield maddy prior and the queen s college girls choir album cover of qe two one nine eight zero around the time of incantations oldfield underwent a controversial self assertiveness therapy course known as exegesis no doubt as a result of this the formerly reclusive musician staged a major european tour to promote the album chronicled in his live album exposed much of which was recorded at the national exhibition centre near birmingham the first ever concert at that venue in one nine seven five oldfield received a grammy award for best instrumental composition in tubular bells theme from the exorcist the early one nine eight zero s saw oldfield make a transition to mainstream popular music beginning with the inclusion of shorter instrumental tracks and contemporary cover versions on platinum and qe two the latter named after the cruise ship soon afterwards he turned his attention to songwriting with a string of collaborations featuring various lead vocalists alongside his trademark searing guitar solos the best known of these is moonlight shadow his one nine eight three hit with maggie reilly which took john lennon s death as one of its themes this hit has been covered by various other artists including aselin debison canadian folk singer and dj mystic electronic techno in two zero

during this period was actually a cover version hall family man for the duo s one nine eight two album h two zero oldfield later turned to film and video writing the score for roland joff s acclaimed film the killing fields and producing substantial video footage for his album islands this was however a time of much friction with his record label virgin records reportedly insisting that any future instrumental album should be billed as tubular bells two oldfield s rebellious response was amarok an hour long work featuring rapidly changing themes supposedly devised to make cutting a single from the album impossible unpredictable bursts of noise and a very cleverly hidden morse code insult directed at richard branson although regarded by many fans as his greatest work it was not a commercial success his parting shot from the virgin label was heaven s open which continued the veiled attacks on branson but was notable for being the first time oldfield had contributed all the lead vocals himself some say this was due to his anxiety to quit virgin as soon as possible he had previously stated that his voice did not belong on his recordings his relationship with richard branson was never good even in the beginning album cover of the songs of distant earth one nine nine four one nine nine two two zero zero three warner years on the warner label oldfield continued to embrace new musical styles with tubular bells ii a re interpretation of tubular bells the album that originally shot him to fame which was premiered at a live concert at edinburgh castle the songs of distant earth the latter based on arthur c clarke s novel of the same name exhibiting a softer new age sound and tubular bells iii also premiered at a concert this time in horse guards parade london drawing from the dance music scene at his new home on the island of ibiza during one nine nine nine oldfield released two albums the first being guitars which used guitars as the source for all the sounds on the album including percussion the second the millennium bell consisted of pastiches of a number of styles of music that represented various stages in history over the past millennium and the work was performed

recording of the original tubular bells on cd and dvd audio this was done to fix many imperfections in the original that existed due to limitations of the recording technologies of the time and limitations in time that he could spend in the recording studio this celebrated the three zero th anniversary of tubular bells and the fact that oldfield had recently celebrated his five zero th birthday the dvd audio version has not only the same content as the cd version in surround but it also has some demos of the original tubular bells in the two zero zero three version the original

instrumentalists natives of berkshire new age musicians old redingensians mutual recursion is a form of recursion where two mathematical or computational functions are defined in terms of each other for instance consider two functions a x and b x defined as follows a x begin one x le one b x two x one end b x a x three four mutual recursion is very common in the functional programming style and is often used for programs written in lisp scheme ml and similar languages in languages such as prolog mutual recursion is almost unavoidable some programming styles discourage mutual recursion claiming that it can be confusing to distinguish the conditions which will return an answer from the conditions that would allow the code to run forever without producing an answer computer science a metasyntactic variable is either a placeholder name a kind of alias term commonly used to denote the subject matter under discussion or a random member of a class of things under discussion the term originates from computer programming and other technical contexts and is commonly used in examples by hackers and programmers the use of a metasyntactic variable is helpful in freeing a programmer from creating a logically named variable although the invented term may also become sufficiently popular and enter the language as a neologism the word foo is the canonical example the phenomenon is similar to the use in algebra of x y and z for unknown variables and a b and c for unknown constants widgets are also used in business to indicate an as yet unspecified product and are frequently sold by the acme company metasyntactic variables are so called because they are variables in the metalanguage used to talk about programs etc see also pseudocode they are variables whose values are often variables as in usages like the value of f foo bar is the sum of foo and bar examples nonsense words foo bar baz and boo foo is the canonical metasyntactic variable commonly used to represent an as yet unspecified term value process function destination or event but seldom a person see ned baker below it is sometimes combined with bar to make foobar this suggests that foo may have originated with the world war ii slang term fubar as an acronym for fucked fouled fixed up beyond all recognition repair although the jargon file makes a reasonably good case that foo predates fubar foo was also used as a nonsense word in the surrealistic comic strip smokey stover that was popular in the one nine four zero s and one nine five zero s see also foo fighter for more foo etymology as well as rfc three zero nine two another usage of foo is as an abbreviation of the phrase forward observation officer or observer apparently foos used to go places well forward of normal troops in battle and leave a stylised chalk graffiti of a person looking over a wall with the words foo was here see also the american version kilroy was here the term kung foo from kung fu has come to mean skill in computer programming this is actually used though misspelled in the movie the core this usage itself has spawned variants such as the gimp s script fu plugin it is also used to refer to specialized skill regarding a certain programming language or tool as in sed fu bar the canonical second metasyntactic variable typically follows foo baz the canonical third metasyntactic variable is commonly used after foo and bar it is also a common arabic surname and occasionally appears in the united kingdom as a short form of the forename barry boo the canonical fourth metasyntactic variable is commonly used after foo bar and baz foo bar baz and boo are often compounded together to make such words as foobar barbaz and foobaz gazonk gazonk is often used as an alternative for baz or as a fourth metasyntactic variable some early versions of the popular editor emacs used gazonk foo as a default filename quux quux introduced by guy l steele jr is the canonical fourth metasyntactic variable commonly used after baz however more recently qux has become more common as the fourth variable displacing quux as the fifth a probable reason for this is that quux is often followed by the series quuux quuuux quuuuux etc and qux fits this pattern perfectly interestingly in amateur radio world qux means what is the magnetic course to you bat bat is used by some programmers as an alternative to quuux xyzzy the word xyzzy is the magic word from the colossal cave adventure and therefore is often used as a metasyntactic variable especially by old school hackers it turns up occasionally in other contexts such as being the cheat code for minesweeper on earlier versions of microsoft windows shme shme is infrequently used in various environments such as berkeley geoworks ingres quovadx pronounced shmeh with a short e hukarz hukarz pronounced who cares is sometimes used by certain functional programmers e g to initialise variables in untyped languages when the value assigned to the variable is immaterial but it is necessary to declare the variable rfc three zero nine two rfc three zero nine two lists the standard list of metasyntactic variables as follows foo bar baz qux quux corge grault garply waldo fred plugh xyzzy thud english words spam and eggs spam and eggs are the canonical metasyntactic variables used in the python programming language this is a reference to a famous comedy sketch by monty python after which the language is named needle and haystack needle and haystack are commonly used in computer programming to describe the syntax of functions that involve a search parameter and a search target such as searching a substring within a string with these two words derived from the idiom to find a needle in a haystack it is clearer where the substring for which to search goes and where the string in which to search goes this can be seen for instance in the documentation for some functions in the computer language php see for an example wibble first recorded in the one eight four zero s alongside wobble wibble rose to prominence after it was used as a nonsense word in the roger irrelevant cartoon strip in uk adult comic viz in the one nine eight zero s and later used in an episode of blackadder goes forth in one nine eight nine the term is also used as a synonym for chatter and other contentless remarks and rarely as a way of pronouncing www wibble has also become something of an internet simming phenomena with various websites dedicated to the so called cult of wibble the word gained immense popularity when dr samuel ramsden used it as his trademark sign off on posts within the section four seven star trek forums community from two zero zero zero onwards it was quickly adopted by other members of the site and spread to other trek rpgs ramsden was later said to regret creating this particular application of the word as it had gone out of control and become more of an irritant than a humouress mark of respect for the net simming legend other examples other words used as metasyntactic variables include beekeeper blarg bleh blort corge doit dothestuff garply glarb grault hoge kalaa mum puppu stuff sub temp test thud var waldo momo plugh like xyzzy is a magic word from the colossal cave adventure similarly blort is the name of a magic potion in zork the term blah is often used because of its use as a placeholder term in common english speech for example here is how one might describe casually how to write a letter in colloquial english you write dear so and so blah blah blah sincerely your name numbers two three the number two three is also commonly used as an integer example particularly when the connotations associated with four two are undesirable this number is popularized in the illuminatus trilogy by robert anton wilson and robert shea four two the number four two is often a common initializer for integer variables and acts in the same vein as a metasyntactic value it is taken from douglas adams the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy where deep thought concluded that it was the answer to life the universe and everything four seven the number four seven is sometimes used instead of four two above and is used mainly by members of the four seven society pomona college graduates or new trek fans six nine six nine is often used as an example number popular among hackers as an addition to metasyntactic variables foo six nine bar six nine also used in all sorts of hacks six nine is popular because of its reference to a sexual position it is also because it is the largest number whose factorial can be calculated by a pocket calculator limited to standard scientific notation with a two digit exponent six six six six six six is the number of the beast and often refers to something considered bad or evil zero eight one five zero eight one five named after the repetitive and boring mg zero eight one five training is used in german as either a random number or

where hae ye been they hae slain the earl amurray sic and lady mondegreen the actual line is and laid him on the green from the anonymous one seven th century ballad the bonnie earl o murray wright

strange battle cry haffely gaffely gaffely gonward half a league half a league half a league onward from the charge of the light brigade the columnist jon carroll of the san francisco chronicle has long been a popularizer of the term and a collector of mondegreens he may have been the chief link between wright s work and the general popularity of the notion today while mondegreens are a common occurrence for children many adults have their own collection particularly with regard to popular music an especially notorious example of a mondegreen is the kingsmen s recording of louie louie though it was a cover of a benign richard berry tune this version was thought first incomprehensible then obscene due either to poor enunciation poor acoustics or poor mixing many young people did indeed write and circulate sets of obscene alternate lyrics and parents also finding the song unintelligible assumed these to be correct this prompted an fbi investigation and the song was quickly

computer science merge sort or mergesort is a sorting algorithm for rearranging lists or any other data structure that can only be accessed sequentially e g file streams into a specified order it is a particularly good example of the divide and conquer algorithmic paradigm it is a comparison sort algorithm conceptually merge sort works as follows divide the unsorted list into two sublists of about half the size sort each of the two sublists merge the two sorted sublists back into one sorted list the algorithm was invented by john von neumann in one nine four five in simple pseudocode the algorithm could look something like this function mergesort m var list left right if length m one return m else middle length m two for each x in m up to middle add x to left for each x in m after middle add x to right left mergesort left right mergesort right result merge left right return result end if analysis mergesort has an average and worst case performance of o n log n in the worst case merge sort does about three zero fewer comparisons than quicksort does in the average case thus merge sort very often needs to make fewer comparisons than quicksort in terms of moves merge sort s worst case complexity is o n log n the same complexity as quicksort s best case and merge sort s best case takes about half as much time as the worst case however merge sort performs two n one method calls in the worst case compared to quicksort s n thus has roughly twice as much recursive overhead as quicksort mergesort s most common implementation does not sort in place meaning memory the size of the input must be allocated for the sorted output to be stored in sorting in place is possible but requires an extremely complicated implementation merge sort is much more efficient than quicksort if the data to be sorted can only be efficiently accessed sequentially and is thus popular in languages such as lisp where sequentially accessed data structures are very common unlike some optimized implementations of quicksort merge sort is a stable sort as long as the merge operation is implemented properly more precisely merge sort does between n log n n one and n log n zero nine one four n comparisons merge sorting tape drives merge sort is so inherently sequential that it s practical to run it using slow tape drives as input and output devices it requires very little memory and the memory required does not change with the number of data elements if you have four tape drives it works as follows divide the data to be sorted in half and put half on each of two tapes merge individual pairs of records from the two tapes write two record chunks alternately to each of the two output tapes merge the two record chunks from the two output tapes into four record chunks write these alternately to the original two input tapes merge the four record chunks into eight record chunks write these alternately to the original two output tapes repeat until you have one chunk containing all the data sorted that is for log n passes where n is the number of records on tape drives that can run both backwards and forwards you can run merge passes in both directions avoiding rewind time for the same reason it is also very useful for sorting data on disk that is too large to fit entirely into primary memory optimizing merge sort this might seem to be of historical interest only but on modern computers locality of reference is of paramount importance in software optimization because multi level memory hierarchies are used in some sense main ram can be seen as a fast tape drive level three cache memory as a slightly faster one level two cache memory as faster still and so on in some circumstances cache reloading might impose unacceptable overhead and a carefully crafted merge sort might result in a significant improvement in running time this opportunity might change if fast memory becomes very cheap again or if exotic architectures like the tera mta become commonplace designing a merge sort to perform optimally often requires adjustment to available hardware eg number of tape drives or size and speed of the relevant cache memory levels comparison with other sort algorithms although heap sort has the same time bounds as merge sort it requires only one auxiliary space instead of merge sort s n and is consequently often faster in practical implementations quicksort however is considered by many to be the fastest general purpose sort algorithm in practice its average case complexity is o n log n with a much smaller coefficient in good implementations than merge sort s even though it is quadratic in the worst case on the plus side merge sort is a stable sort parallelizes better and is more efficient at handling slow to access sequential media merge sort is often the best choice for sorting a linked list in this situation it is relatively easy to implement a merge sort in such a way that it does not require n auxiliary space instead only one and the slow random access performance of a linked list makes some other algorithms such as quick sort perform poorly and others such as heapsort completely impossible as of perl five eight merge sort is its default sorting algorithm it was quicksort in previous versions of perl in java the arrays sort methods use mergesort and a tuned quicksort depending on the datatypes utility in online sorting mergesort s merge operation is useful in online sorting where the list to be sorted is received a piece at a time instead of all at the beginning see online algorithm in this application we sort each new piece that is received using any sorting algorithm and then merge it into our sorted list so far using the merge operation however this approach can be expensive in time and space if the received pieces are small compared to the sorted list a better approach in this case is to store the list in a self balancing binary search tree and add elements to it as they are

founder of a very different branch of clinical psychology rooted in the writings of shinran the founder of shinshu buddhism in his capacity as the head of psychiatry for a large tokyo hospital morita masatake also pronounced shoma began developing his methods while working with sufferers of shinkietshitsu a chronic shyness common in japanese culture in the morita view how we feel is important as a sensation as an indicator for the present moment but feelings are seen as uncontrollable we don t create feelings feelings happen to us since feelings do not cause our behavior we can coexist with unpleasant feelings while still taking constructive action my way of doing things is simple it s not necessary to make impossible efforts when troubled put simply when you are vexed just be vexed and say yes and what shall i do just be in suspense about the outcome and move forward a little at a time the essence of morita s method is often summarized in three rules accept all our feelings know our purpose s and do what needs to be done when once asked what shy people should do morita replied sweat accept your feelings accepting feelings is not ignoring them or avoiding them but welcoming them vietnamese poet and writer thich nhat hanh recommends we say hello loneliness how are you today come sit by me and i will take care of you morita s advice in feelings it is best to be wealthy and generous that is have many and let them fly as they wish know your purpose implicit in morita s method and the traditional buddhist psychological principles which he adapted is an independence of thought and action something a little alien to the western ideal to follow our whims and moods morita held that we can no more control our thoughts than we can control the weather as both are phenomenon of most amazingly complex natural systems and if we have no hope of controlling our emotions we can hardly be held responsible any more than we can be held responsible for feeling hot or cold we do however have complete dominion over our behavior and for morita that is a sacred responsibility what needs doing now is like a mantra in his methods do what needs doing one can feel crushed and alone or hurt and homicidal while pulling up the weeds in your garden but one wouldn t be doing it at all if one hadn t intended to raise flowers morita s way of treatment is very different from the western diagnosis disease model morita s methods lead his students through experiments and in each assignment the lesson is not explained by a master but learned first hand through the doing or

their macintosh line of computer systems the original mac os is often credited for popularizing the graphical user interface successfully it was first introduced in one nine eight four with the original macintosh the macintosh one two eight k apple deliberately played down the existence of the operating system in the early years of the macintosh to help make the machine appear more user friendly and to distance it from other operating systems such as ms dos which were portrayed as arcane and technically challenging apple wanted macintosh to be portrayed as a system for the rest of us therefore the term mac os didn t really exist until it was officially used during the mid one nine nine zero s the term has since been applied to all versions of the mac system software prior to this as a handy way to refer to it when discussing it in context with other operating systems earlier versions of the mac os were compatible only with m six eight k based macintoshes while later versions were also compatible with the powerpc ppc architecture most recently mac os x has become compatible with intel s x eight six architecture versions the macintosh operating system initially consisted of two pieces of software called system and finder each with its own version number they were bundled for upgrades as system software with a single version number for each combination this was formally shortened to system and the component version numbers synchronised with system six system seven five one was the first to include the mac os logo a blue variation of a smiley face and mac os seven six was the first to be named mac os to ensure that users would still identify it with apple even when used in clones from other companies until the advent of the later powerpc g three based systems significant parts of the system were stored in physical rom on the motherboard the initial purpose of this was to avoid using up the limited storage of floppy disks on system support given that the early macs had no hard disk only one model of mac was ever actually bootable using the rom alone the one nine nine one mac classic model this architecture also helped to ensure that only apple computers and later licensed clones with the copyright protected roms could run mac os the mac os can be divided into two families of operating systems classic mac os the system which shipped with the first macintosh in one nine eight four and its descendants culminating with mac os nine the newer mac os x the x is pronounced ten as the roman numeral mac os x incorporates elements of openstep thus also bsd unix and mach and mac os nine its low level bsd based foundation darwin is free software open source software classic mac os one nine eight four two zero zero one original one nine eight four mac os desktop the classic mac os is characterized by its total lack of a command line it is a completely graphical operating system heralded for its ease of use it is also criticized for its singletasking in early versions or cooperative multitasking in later versions very limited memory management lack of protected memory and susceptibility to conflicts among extensions that extend the operating system providing additional functionality such as networking or support for a particular device some extensions may not work properly together or work only when loaded in a particular order troubleshooting mac os extensions can be a time consuming process of trial and error mac os originally used the macintosh file system mfs a flat file system with only one kludged level of folders this was replaced by the hierarchical file system hfs which had a true directory tree both file systems are otherwise compatible most file systems used with dos unix or other operating systems treat a file as simply a sequence of bytes requiring an application to know which bytes represented what type of information by contrast mfs and hfs gave files two different forks the data fork contained the same sort of information as other file systems such as the text of a document or the bitmaps of an image file the resource fork contained other structured data such as menu definitions graphics sounds or code segments a file might consist only of resources with an empty data fork or only a data fork with no resource fork a text file could contain its text in the data fork and styling information in the resource fork so that an application which didn t recognize the styling information could still read the raw text on the other hand these forks provided a challenge to interoperability with other operating systems copying a file from a mac to a non mac system would strip it of its resource fork the classic os is still supported and shipped in addition to os x with powerpc but not intel macs as late as early two zero zero six mac os x two zero zero one present current two zero zero six mac os x desktop mac os x brought unix style memory management and pre emptive multitasking to the mac platform it is based on the mach kernel and the bsd implementation of unix which were incorporated into nextstep the object oriented operating system developed by steve jobs next company the new memory management system allowed more programs to run at once and virtually eliminated the possibility of one program crashing another it is also the second macintosh operating system to include a command line the first is the now discontinued a ux which supported classic mac os applications on top of a unix kernel although it is never seen unless the user launches a terminal emulator however since these new features put higher demands on system resources mac os x only officially supported the powerpc g three and newer processors and now has even higher requirements the additional requirement of built in firewire ieee one three nine four as of mac os x v one zero four even then it runs somewhat slowly on older g three systems for many purposes as of two zero zero five every update to mac os x since the original public beta has had the atypical quality of being perceptibly more responsive than the version it replaced the opposite to the trend of most operating systems as noted by john siracusa of ars technica for over three years now mac os x has gotten faster with every release and not just faster in the experience of most end users but faster on the same hardware this trend is unheard of among contemporary desktop operating systems this could however be attributed to the relative immaturity of the os and the speed gains have diminished as os x has matured some reports regarding mac os x one zero four suggested that it seemed similar to version one zero three in responsiveness or even slower at times power pc builds of mac os x includes a compatibility layer for running older mac applications the classic environment this runs a full copy of the older mac os version nine one or later in a mac os x process powerpc based macs ship with os nine two as well as os x os nine two must be installed by the user it is not installed by default as of early two zero zero six the classic environment does not work in the x eight six version of os x most well written classic applications function properly under this environment but compatibility is only assured if the software was written to be unaware of the actual hardware and to interact solely with the operating system users of the original mac os generally upgraded to mac os x but a few criticized it as being more difficult and less user friendly than the original mac os for the lack of certain features that had not been re implemented in the new os or for being slower on the same hardware especially older hardware or other sometimes serious incompatibilities with the older os because drivers for printers scanners tablets etc written for the older mac os are not compatible with mac os x and due to the lack of os x support for older apple machines a significant number of macintosh users have continued using the older os by two zero zero five it is reported that almost all users of systems capable of running mac os x are so doing with only a small percentage still running the classic mac os in june two zero zero five steve jobs announced at his worldwide developers conference keynote that apple computers would be transitioning from powerpc to intel processors at the same conference jobs announced developer transition kits that included beta versions of apple software including mac os x that developers could use to test their applications as they ported them to run on intel powered macs in january two zero zero six apple released the first macintosh computers with intel processors an imac and the macbook pro classic mac os technologies some features of the classic mac os are still in use in mac os x including colorsync colorsync is a technology for matching colors between the screen and a printer finder the finder is the interface for browsing the filesystem and launching applications mac os roman mac os roman is the character encoding used in macintosh systems plaintalk plaintalk is a speech synthesis and speech recognition technology it is still a part of the macintosh operating system although the proprietary microphone interface bearing the same name was phased out with the introduction of the blue and white powermac g three s in one nine nine nine quickdraw quickdraw was the first imaging model to provide mass market wysiwyg capabilities although mostly obsolete on mac os x due to the use of quartz quickdraw still works on mac os x one zero four quicktime quicktime provides support for audio visual playback obsolete technologies many technologies of the classic mac os are no longer used on os x including chooser the chooser is a tool for enabling appletalk and accessing and selecting network resources such as printers it was derived from the choose printer desk accessory found in early version of the mac os desk accessories desk accessories were small helper applications that could be run concurrently with other applications prior to the advent of the multi tasking multifinder and system seven they have not been used in the mac os since system seven mac os memory management this term describes how the macintosh managed ram and virtual memory before the switch to the unix based mac os x it has been defunct since mac os x but most of the apis are still available via the carbon compatibility layer multifinder multifinder was a version of the finder with support for simultaneous processes it became a part of the finder in system seven powerpc emulation of the motorola six eight zero zero zero this refers to the way in which the macintosh handled the architectural transition to the powerpc microprocessor this has been obsolete since mac os x as mac os x only runs software built for the powerpc however a similar emulation technology is seen in rosetta which allows an intel based macintosh to emulate software built for powerpc based macintoshes project star trek one interesting historical aspect of the classic mac os was a relatively unknown secret prototype apple started work on in one nine nine two code named project star trek the goal of this project was to create a version of mac os that would run on intel compatible x eight six personal computers it was short lived being cancelled only one year later in one nine nine three due to political infighting though its team was able to get the macintosh finder and some basic applications like quicktime running smoothly on a pc although the star trek software was never released third party macintosh emulators such as vmac basilisk ii and executor eventually made it possible to run the classic mac os on intel based pcs these emulators were restricted to emulating the six eight zero zero zero series of processors and as such couldn t run versions of the mac os that succeeded eight one which required powerpc processors recently the pearpc emulator has appeared which is capable of emulating the powerpc processors required by newer versions of the mac os like mac os x unfortunately it is still in the early stages and like many emulators tends to run much slower than a native os would another ppc emulator is sheepshaver which has been around since one nine nine eight for the beos platform but in two zero zero two was open sourced with porting efforts beginning to get it to run on other platforms although it is capable of emulating a powerpc processor it can only emulate up to mac os nine zero four because it does not emulate a memory management unit of course it is interesting to note that one six years after project star trek the current version of mac os v one zero four four runs smoothly on x eight six architecture since the imac and macbook pro are built around intel chips the imac and the macbook pro are the first two models of a complete apple switch to x eight six architecture see also project marklar below project marklar in april two zero zero two eweek reported a rumor that apple had a version of mac os x running on x eight six processors code named marklar the idea behind marklar was to keep mac os x running on an alternate platform should apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the powerpc platform these rumors subsided until late in may two zero zero five when cnet reported that apple would unveil marklar in the coming months the rumor was confirmed by apple s ceo steve jobs in june two zero zero five when he announced that future macintosh products will run on intel processors starting in two zero zero six after pre release x eight six based macs were released to developers a copy of the x eight six based version of mac os x was leaked onto the internet and hackers managed to get it to run on non apple x eight six based pcs apple s plans to fully port mac os x from ibm s powerpc processors to intel s x eight six processors include rosetta which roughly translates g three instructions to pentium instructions for applications in active development apple s latest version of xcode permits an application to be built for both the g five and intel processors simultaneously these universal binaries are similar to making a fat binary in the mid one nine nine zero s which would hold both six eight zero x zero and powerpc instructions during apple s transition to the powerpc architecture mac os x for the x eight six architecture requires an intel pentium four or amd athlon six four processor as it utilizes sse sse two and sse three instructions mac os x x eight six was first available for sale in the apple store in january two zero zero six it cost one two nine nine for an imac and one nine nine nine for the newly introduced macbook pro translation emulation and macintosh clones some computers have been shown to successfully run mac os using the process of translation emulation one example of this is the amiga that successfully ran classic mac os using translation emulation for either the m six eight k or powerpc processors example emulators include shapeshifter by the same programmer that conceived sheepshaver christian bauer not to be confused with the third party preference pane shapeshifter fusion and ifusion the latter ran classic mac os using translation emulation with a powerpc coprocessor accelerator card this form of emulation has been said to equal or better the speed of a macintosh with the same processor especially with respect to the m six eight k series due to real macs running in mmu trap mode hampering performance with the introduction of intel macs it has been speculated that mac os could be run by a intel or compatible pc via translation emulation but this has yet to be demonstrated and is strongly opposed by apple several computer manufacturers over the years have made macintosh clones capable of running mac os notably power computing and umax these machines normally ran various versions of classic mac os steve jobs ended the clone licensing program after returning to apple in one nine nine seven a ux in one nine eight eight apple released its first unix based os named a ux this was an operating system that seamlessly integrated the mac os look and feel with the power and flexibility of unix since it was before the advent of powerpc and therefore had to run on the motorola six eight zero zero zero processor it was not very competitive for its time a ux had most of its success in sales to the federal government of the united states where unix was a requirement that mac os could not meet see also mac os history mac os x history mac os x server list of macintosh software operating system advocacy comparison of operating systems external links folklore org a

with the mac os operating system then known as the system software the macintosh is widely regarded as and credited for popularizing the graphical user interface the mac os has been pre installed on almost every macintosh computer ever sold the operating system is also sold separately to the computer the original mac os was heavily based on the lisa os previously released by apple for the lisa computer in one nine eight three and also used concepts licensed from the xerox parc xerox alto which steve jobs and several other macintosh team members had been previewed in december one nine seven nine also in one nine eight four apple partnered with microsoft in an agreement where microsoft would create versions of word and multiplan predecessor to excel for the mac os for the majority of the one nine eight zero s the mac os lacked a serious amount of software compatible with it with the introduction of system seven more software began to become available for the platform system six was the first major change of the operating system although the mac os kernel was kept the same from the system seven revision until the last revision of the os mac os nine early history development the macintosh project started in early one nine seven nine with jef raskin who envisioned an easy to use low cost computer for the average consumer in september one nine seven nine raskin was given permission to start hiring for the project and was in particular looking for an engineer that could put together a prototype bill atkinson a member of the lisa team introduced him to burrell smith a service technician who had been hired earlier that year in january one nine eight one steve jobs completely took over the macintosh project jobs and a number of apple engineers visited xerox parc in december one nine seven nine three months after the lisa and macintosh projects had begun after hearing about the pioneering gui technology being developed at xerox parc from former xerox employees such as jef raskin steve jobs negotiated a visit to see the xerox alto computer and smalltalk development tools in exchange for apple stock options the final lisa and macintosh operating systems most used concepts from the xerox alto but many elements of the graphical user interface were created by apple including the menubar and pop up menus the click and drag theory was developed by jef raskin unlike the ibm pc which used eight kb of system rom for power on self test post and basic input output chores bios the mac rom was significantly larger six four kb and held key os code much of the original mac rom was coded by andy hertzfeld a member of the original macintosh team he was able to conserve some of the precious rom space by interleaving some of the assembly language code in addition to coding the rom he also coded the kernel the macintosh toolbox and some of the desktop accessories das as well the icons of the operating system which represented folders and application software were designed by susan kare who later designed the icons for microsoft windows three zero steve capps wrote the macintosh finder and macintosh system utilities release original one nine eight four mac os desktop the first version of the mac os then known as the system software or more simply the system was system version one zero it is easily distinguished between other operating systems from the same period because it does not use a command line interface it was one of the first operating systems to use an entirely graphical user interface it bundled with the original macintosh one two eight k in one nine eight four up until may one nine eight four when it was updated to version one one including only minor changes additional to the system kernel is the finder an application used for file management which also displays the desktop these releases could only run one application at a time though special application shells such as switcher discussed under multifinder could work around this to some extent systems one zero one one and two zero used a flat file system with only one kludged level of folders called macintosh file system mfs its support for folders subdirectories was incomplete system two one finder five zero introduced the hfs hierarchical file system which had real directories system three zero was introduced with the mac plus adding support for several new technologies including scsi and appletalk and introducing trash bulging i e when the trash contained files it would gain a bulged appearance system four zero came with the mac se and macintosh ii changes in early macintosh operating systems are best reflected in the version number of the finder where major leaps are found between one x four x five x and six x system one zero finder one zero january one nine eight four system one one finder one one g may one nine eight four system two zero finder four one april one nine eight five system two one finder five zero september one nine eight five system three zero finder five one january one nine eight six system three two finder five three june one nine eight six system four zero finder five four january one nine eight seven system four one finder five five april one nine eight seven system five system five added multifinder an add on replacement for the finder which could run several programs at once time was given to the background applications only when the foreground or running applications gave it up co operative multitasking but in fact most of them did via a clever change in the os s event handling the other significant change that system five brought to the mac was color quickdraw which debuted with the macintosh ii this significantly altered the extent and design of the underlying graphics architecture and its apis but it is a credit to apple that most users and perhaps more importantly existing code were largely unaware of this system five was also the first macintosh operating system to be given a unified macintosh system software version number as opposed to the numbers used for the system and finder files system software five zero system four two finder six zero multifinder one zero system software five one system four three finder six zero multifinder one zero system five was available for a very short time and only in some countries including the united states system six system six running two applications and a desktop accessory system six was the first major upgrade of the mac os it consolidated the previous releases into a much more complete and stable operating system it also moved the mac to true three two bit memory addressing necessary for the ever increasing amounts of ram available earlier systems used the lower two four bits for addressing and the upper eight bits for flags this was an effective solution for earlier macintosh models with very limited amounts of ram but it became a liability later apple termed code that assumed the two four eight bit addressing not three two bit clean and developers were required to excise such assumptions from their code system software six zero system four four finder six one multifinder one one the version numbers of the system and multifinder files were changed to six zero just before the public release system software six zero one system software six zero two system software six zero three system software six zero four system software six zero five system software six zero six never released system software six zero seven system software six zero eight identical to system six zero seven but configured with system seven zero printing software for printer sharing with system seven last version that could run on the original mac one two eight k system software six zero eight l only for macintosh classic classic ii powerbook one zero zero macintosh lc lc ii system seven screenshot of system seven five three revision two on may one three one nine nine one system seven was released it was the first considerably major upgrade to the mac os adding a significant user interface overhaul new applications stability improvements and many new features the most visible change was a new full color user interface although this feature made for a visually appealing interface it was optional on machines not capable of displaying color or those with their display preferences set to monochrome the interface defaulted back to the black and white of previous versions only some interface elements were colorized scrollbars had a new look but push buttons remained in black and white the most notable of all the features added in system seven includes the built in co operative multitasking in system six this function was optional through the multifinder system seven also introduced aliases similar to shortcuts that were introduced in later versions of microsoft windows system extensions were enhanced by being moved to their own subfolder a subfolder in the system folder was also created for the control panels later versions of system seven offered a feature called extensions manager which simplified the process of enabling and disabling extensions the apple menu in system six home only to desktop accessories was made user editable the user could now place aliases to often used folders and applications in the menu by placing them in an apple menu items subfolder in the system folder applescript a scripting language for automating tasks was also introduced with system seven three two bit quickdraw supporting so called true color imaging was also included as standard it was previously available as a system extension quickdraw was used in mac os for fast on screen drawing truetype an outline font standard also included in microsoft windows three one was integrated into the operating system the trash under system six and earlier would empty itself automatically when one quit or if multifinder were not running when one launched an application system seven reimplemented the trash as a special instance of a regular folder allowing files to remain in it across reboots until the user performed an empty trash command systems seven one and seven five introduced a large number of high level additions considered by some to be less well thought out than they could have been some of the most confusing were the reliance on countless system enablers to support new hardware and various system update extensions with inconsistent version numbering schemes overall stability and performance also gradually worsened during this period which introduced powerpc support and six eight k emulation stability returned with mac os seven six which dropped the system moniker as a growing market of third party manufacturers licensed the software from apple for macintosh clones which competed directly against apple s own hardware although the version number was subsequently changed to eight x and nine x the internal core of the os remained basically the same system seven zero released in late one nine nine one integrated multifinder into the os as default system seven zero one introduced with lc ii and quadra series system seven tuner update for both seven zero and seven zero one system seven one system seven one pro version seven one one combined with powertalk speech manager mac os system seven five two first version for powermacs that use pci expansion cards usable only on these power macs and powerbooks five three zero zero and duo two three zero zero system seven five three system seven five update two zero system seven five three l only for mac clones system seven five three revision two system seven five three revision two one only for performa six four zero zero one eight zero and six four zero zero one two zero system seven five five mac os seven six name formally changed because of the experimental clone program although system seven five one and later used the mac os name on the splash screen mac os seven six one macintosh performa computers used to have their own exclusive operating system before they were merged into system seven five system seven zero one p system seven one p one system seven one p two system seven one p three last release with new features system seven one p four system seven one p five system seven one p six mac os eight mac os eight one desktop mac os eight was released on july two six one nine nine seven shortly after steve jobs returned to the company it was mainly released to keep the mac os moving forward during a difficult time for apple initially planned as mac os seven seven it was renumbered eight to accomplish jobs goal of exploiting a legal loophole to terminate third party manufacturers licenses to system seven and effectively shut down the macintosh clone market eight zero added a number of features from the stillborn copland project while leaving the underlying operating system unchanged a multi threaded finder was included enabling for better multi tasking the gui was changed in appearance to a new shaded greyscale look called platinum and the ability to change the appearance themes also known as skins was added with a new control panel this capability was provided by a new appearance api layer within the os one of the few significant changes apple sold one two million copies of mac os eight in its first two weeks of availability and three million within six months mac os eight one saw the introduction of an updated version of the hfs and hfs file systems which fixed many of the limitations of the earlier system hfs continues to be used in mac os x there were some other interface changes such as separating network features from printing the venerable and rather odd chooser was at last headed for retirement and some improvements to application switching however in underlying technical respects mac os eight was not very different from system seven mac os eight zero mac os eight one last version to run on either a six eight k or powerpc processor added support for usb on the bondi imac mac os eight five first version to run only on a powerpc processor added support for firewire on the powermac g three mac os eight six ran on top of a nanokernel for improved performance added support for the powerpc g four processor mac os nine mac os nine mac os nine was released on october two three one nine nine nine it was generally a steady evolution from mac os eight in fact the only reason that the version was increased from eight to nine was to pave the way for the upcoming mac os x rather than leave a gap in the version numbers which might have discouraged some to make the eventual transition from classic mac os to mac os x mac os nine was originally planned to be named mac os eight seven os nine also added some transitional technologies to help application developers adopt some os x features before the introduction of the new os to the public again easing the transition these included new apis for the file system and the bundling of the carbon library that apps could link against instead of the traditional api libraries apps that were adapted to do this can be run natively on os x as well other changes were made in os nine to allow it to be booted in the classic environment within os x this is a compatibility layer in os x in fact an os x application known in developer circles as the blue box that runs a complete mac os nine operating system so allowing applications that have not been ported to carbon to run on mac os x this is reasonably seamless though classic applications retain their

history the franchise originated in kansas city missouri in one eight nine four moved to washington d c in one nine zero one when the american league was formed and played there through the one nine six zero season kansas city blues one eight nine four one nine zero zero the kansas city blues were a charter member of the western league a minor league at the time byron ban johnson president of the western league changed the name to the american league in one nine zero zero and major league status was awarded a year later the blues were champions of the western league in one eight nine eight taking the league by a game and a half from the indianapolis hoosiers washington nationals senators one nine zero one one nine six zero the washington ballclub was known by two nicknames the nationals and the senators for most of its history prior to moving to minnesota the team was called the senators from one nine zero one zero four before the one nine zero five season team owner thomas c noyes asked a group of sports editors to come up with a new name they chose nationals from the team actually wore nationals on their jerseys the first team to do so otherwise the jerseys either read washington or carried a plain block w newspaper articles for decades used the names senators and nationals or nats interchangeably often within the same article baseball guides even said nationals or senators when listing the nickname by the one nine five zero s nationals was pretty much passe then following the one nine five six season owner clark griffith decided to officially change the name to senators beginning in the one nine five seven season in one nine five nine the word senators finally appeared on their shirts they and their expansion replacement in one nine six one would remain officially the senators for good although space saving headline writers continued to refer to them as nats frequently during the period the team s line up boasted the presence of walter the big train johnson and they won the one nine two four world series they also appeared in the one nine two five and one nine three three series and came very close in one nine four five after that the team fell into mediocrity quickly that along with its poor early years resulted in the team being remembered mostly for its failures rather than its successes during one portion of its history the team was so notoriously inept that it inspired san francisco chronicle columnist charley dryden to joke washington first in war first in peace and last in the american league this was a play on light horse harry lee s remembrance of george washington first in war first in peace first in the hearts of his countrymen the team s difficulties on the field also inspired the book the year the yankees lost the pennant see below washington s bucky harris scores on his home run in the fourth inning of game seven of the world series october one zero one nine two four it is falsely claimed that prior to the cuban revolution fidel castro tried out for the senators as a pitcher during the early one nine five zero s the team played its games at griffith stadium sharing it with the homestead grays of the negro leagues who played some of their games there the washington senators in popular culture the longtime competitive struggles of the team were fictionalized in the book the year the yankees lost the pennant which became the broadway musical and movie damn yankees the plot features a middle aged man named joe hardy who sells his soul to the devil so the washington senators can win the pennant one of the songs from the musical you gotta have heart is frequently played at baseball games team nickname nats short for nationals also sometimes called griffs by inventive headline writers in reference to the club owner minnesota twins one nine six one to present the minnesota designation instead of minneapolis comes from the fact that the team is intended to represent the twin cities of minneapolis st paul and presumably the entire state this fact is reinforced by the stylized tc logo worn on home caps and by their mascot tc bear the name twins derives from the popular name of the region the twin cities one nine six zero s the twins arrive in minnesota and rise in the standings the twins were eagerly greeted in minnesota when they arrived in one nine six one and they advanced to the world series in one nine six five driven by the exciting play of superstar first baseman harmon killebrew they were defeated in the world series by the los angeles dodgers but the championship drive cemented the team s relationship with the people of minnesota one nine seven zero s from first place to mediocrity the team continued to post winning records through one nine seven one winning the first two american league west division titles however they then entered a decade long slump finishing around five zero zero for the next eight years tony oliva and rod carew continued to provide offensive pop but killebrew s batting average suffered and the pitching staff languished one nine eight zero s building a new home a world champion in the early one nine eight zero s the twins fell further winning only three seven of its games in one nine eight one and one nine eight two through one nine eight one the team played its games at metropolitan stadium in bloomington a suburb south of the twin cities the mall of america now occupies the spot where the old met stood complete with home plate and the seat where harmon killebrew hit a five two zero foot home run the one nine eight two season brought the team indoors into the metrodome which is in downtown minneapolis near the mississippi river after several losing seasons in the dome the arrival of one nine eight zero s superstars kent hrbek and kirby puckett electrified the team and sent them to their first world series the twins defeated the st louis cardinals to win the one nine eight seven world series the one nine eight seven twins were unique from the standpoint that with their regular season record of eight five seven seven they became worst preforming team winning percentage wise to win the world series while their five six two five record at the metrodome was the best overall home record for one nine eight seven away from the metrodome the twins had an appalling two nine five two mark the twins only won nine road games after the all star break the twins won even more in one nine eight eight but could not overcome the powerhouse division rival oakland athletics one nine eight nine saw a decline in the win column one nine nine zero s from worst to first to worst again in one nine nine zero the twins surprisingly did quite poorly finishing last in their division with only seven four wins one nine nine one brought breakout years from newcomers shane mack scott leius chili davis and rookie of the year chuck knoblauch along with consistently excellent performances from stars hrbek and puckett the pitching staff excelled as well with scott erickson rick aguilera and st paul native jack morris having all star years the twins defeated the atlanta braves to win the nail biting one nine nine one world series which has been considered by some to be the greatest of all time game six is widely considered to be one of the greatest world series games ever played with the scored tied three three in the bottom of the one one th inning kirby puckett stepped up to the plate and drove the game winning homerun into the left field seats to force a decisive game seven all three of the twins series were decided in seven games with the latter series ending in a dramatic one zero inning one zero shutout by series mvp morris one nine nine one was also the first time any team finishing last in its division the previous year advanced to the world series with both the twins and braves accomplishing this unprecedented feat in both this and the previous twins world series the home team won each game which had never occurred before one nine nine two saw another superb oakland team that the twins could not overcome despite an excellent nine zero win season after one nine nine two the twins again fell into an extended slump posting a losing record each year through two zero zero zero from a long sequence of retirements and injuries including superstars kent hrbek and kirby puckett hurt the team badly and tom kelly spent the remainder of his managerial career attempting to rebuild the twins in one nine nine eight management cleared out the team of all of its players earning over one million dollars except for pitcher brad radke and rebuilt from the ground up the team barely avoided finishing in the cellar that year finishing just five games ahead of perennial cellar dwellers detroit tigers and avoiding the humiliating mark of one zero zero losses by just eight games in one nine nine seven owner carl pohlad almost sold the twins to north carolina businessman don beaver who would have moved the team to the piedmont triad greensboro winston salem high point area of the state the defeat of a referendum for a stadium in that area and a lack of interest in building a stadium for the twins in charlotte killed the deal two zero zero zero s a perennial contender things turned around and in the twins compiled the longest streak of consecutive winning seasons since moving to minnesota going eight five seven seven in two zero zero one nine four six seven in two zero zero two nine zero seven two in two zero zero three nine two seven zero in two zero zero four and eight

series before being eliminated four one by that year s eventual world series champion anaheim angels their streak of three straight division titles along with some bitterly fought games have helped to create an intense rivalry with the chicago white sox in recent years starting with two zero zero zero when the sox clinched the division at the metrodome and heating up especially in two zero zero three two zero zero four and two zero zero five a new ballpark for the two zero one zero s the twins wish to replace the metrodome with a new ballpark within the next half decade claiming that the metrodome generates too little revenue for the twins to be competitive in particular the twins receive no revenue from luxury suite leasing as those are owned by co tenant minnesota vikings and only a small percentage of concessions sales also the percentage of season ticket quality seats in the metrodome is said to be very low compared to other stadiums and the capacity of the stadium is far too high for baseball however attempts to spur interest and push legislative efforts towards a new stadium have repeatedly failed the dome is thought to be an increasingly poor fit for all three of its major tenants the twins the vikings and the university of minnesota golden gophers football team in fact in addition to the twins the vikings and gophers both have new stadium proposals in various stages of development given the strong public opposition to public subsidies for sports stadiums in minnesota it remains to be seen if any of these proposals will move forward thus requiring the twins to go the route of the baseball cardinals and giants in paying for their own stadium quick facts founded one eight nine four as the kansas city missouri franchise in the minor western league moved to

ratio of the speed of an object or flow relative to the speed of sound in the medium through which it is travelling the mach number is commonly used both with objects travelling at high speed in a fluid and with high speed fluid flows inside channels such as nozzles diffusers or wind tunnels as it is defined as a ratio of two speeds it is a dimensionless number at standard sea level conditions mach one is one two two five km h seven six one two mph in the atmosphere since the speed of sound increases as the temperature increases the actual speed of an object travelling at mach one will depend on the fluid temperature around it it can be shown that the mach number is also the ratio of inertial forces also referred to aerodynamic forces to elastic forces the mach number is named after austrian physicist and philosopher ernst mach high speed flow around objects high speed flight can be classified in five categories subsonic ma five for comparison the required speed for low earth orbit is ca seven five km s ma two two zero six in air at sea level at transsonic speeds the flow field around the object includes both sub and supersonic parts the transsonic regime begins when first zones of ma one flow appear around the object in case of an airfoil such as an aircraft s wing this typically happens above the wing supersonic flow can decelerate back to subsonic only in a normal shock this typically happens before the trailing edge fig one a as the velocity increases the zone of ma one flow increases towards both leading and trailing edges as ma one is reached and passed the normal shock reaches the trailing edge and becomes a weak oblique shock the flow decelerates over the shock but remains supersonic a normal shock is created ahead of the object and the only subsonic zone in the flow field is a small area around the object s leading edge fig one b fig one mach number in transsonic airflow around an airfoil ma one b when an aircraft exceeds mach one i e the sound barrier a large pressure difference is created just in front of the aircraft this abrupt pressure difference called a shock wave spreads backward and outward from the aircraft in a cone shape a so called mach cone it is this shock wave that causes the sonic boom heard as fast moving aircraft travels overhead a person inside the aircraft will not hear this the higher the speed the more narrow the cone at just over ma one it is hardly a cone at all but closer to a slighly concave plane at fully supersonic velocity the shock wave starts to take its cone shape and flow is either completely supersonic or in case of a blunt object only a very small subsonic flow area remains between the object s nose and the shock wave it creates ahead of itself in the case of a sharp object there is no air between the nose and the shock wave the shock wave starts from the nose as the mach number increases so does the strength of the shock wave and the mach cone becomes increasingly narrow as the fluid flow crosses the shock wave its speed is reduced and temperature pressure and density increase the stronger the shock the greater the changes at high enough mach numbers the temperature increases so much over the shock that ionization and dissociation of gas molecules behind the shock wave begin such flows are called hypersonic it is clear that any object travelling at hypersonic velocities will likewise be exposed to the same extreme temperatures as the gas behind the nose shock wave and hence choice of heat resistant materials becomes important high speed flow in a channel as a flow in a channel crosses ma one becomes supersonic one significant change takes place common sense would lead one to expect that contracting the flow channel would increase the flow speed and at subsonic speeds this holds true however once the flow becomes supersonic the relationship of flow area and speed is reversed expanding the channel actually increases the speed the obvious result is that in order to accelerate a flow to supersonic one needs a convergent divergent nozzle where the converging section accelerates the flow to ma one and the diverging section continues the acceleration to supersonic such nozzles are called de laval nozzles fluid dynamics dimensionless numbers aerodynamics external links gas dynamics toolbox calculate mach number and normal shock wave

advanced simple profile and h two six four mpeg four avc mpeg seven a formal system for describing multimedia content mpeg two one mpeg describes this future standard as a multimedia framework how mpeg video and audio coding works the most well known mpeg codecs use lossy data compression using transform codecs as of two zero zero five in a typical widely used lossy transform codec samples of picture or sound are taken chopped into small segments called blocks transformed into a frequency space and quantized the resulting quantized values are then entropy coded one alternative to this model would be the use of wavelets rather than block or overlapped block transforms in the chopping into small segments step c f jpeg two zero zero zero this typical model is extended by moving picture coding systems such as mpeg one mpeg two and mpeg four in particular an extra step is added where the picture content is predicted from past reconstructed images before coding and only the differences from the reconstructed pictures and any extra information needed to perform the prediction are coded mpeg standardizes only the bitstream format and how a decoder should interpret such a bitstream the encoding methods themselves and many details about decoders are not standardized in any way although there are reference implementations available that produce valid bitstreams for testing the goal of this standardization approach is that any decoder should be able to decode material produced by any encoder that follows the same standard regardless of which particular encoder or

was convicted of the murder of police officer daniel faulkner which took place on december nine th one nine eight one he received the death sentence from a jury he is most famous for the subsequent mass campaigns for and against his conviction jamal had been awaiting execution in pennsylvania from one nine eight two until december two zero zero one when federal district court judge william yohn overturned his death sentence however yohn reaffirmed jamal s conviction ruling that he will remain in custody indefinitely supporters an anarchist mural in inner city bristol england abu jamal s case has become a popular cause on the political left within the anti globalization movement and among anti death penalty activists as well as the black nationalist movement saving mumia abu jamal from the death penalty is a popular cause among people and organizations who insist he is innocent others without concern for whether he is factually innocent still believe that he did not receive a fair trial a third group of supporters simply oppose the death penalty in general a fourth group object to harsher penalties for killing a police officer than for killing an ordinary citizen many supporters have called for a new trial his release from prison or the commutation of his sentence to life in prison detractors the philadelphia office of the district attorney daniel faulkner s family the fraternal order of police and the jury that heard the case believe that abu jamal killed faulkner while faulkner was engaged in a legal justified arrest in august one nine nine nine the fop s national biennial general meeting passed a resolution calling for an economic boycott of all individuals and businesses that had expressed support for freeing abu jamal in his book dude where s my country filmmaker michael moore has stated that he believes that abu jamal is probably guilty of the faulkner murder and that those defending him may have overlooked the fact that he did indeed kill that cop however moore is against sentencing abu jamal to death due to what he believes was an unfair trial proceeding and his stance against the death penalty in general general disagreements jamal s supporters say that since jamal had taken a high profile position with the black panther party bpp as a teenager he could have been a target of the fbi s cointelpro program whose purpose was to harass disrupt and destroy political groups such as the bpp several other black panthers who were convicted of various crimes including murder have been released when it was learned that the fbi withheld evidence which would have acquitted them such as geronimo pratt jamal s detractors say that the critics of the trial amass numerous small errors to build their case for a larger conspiracy and that the supporters of jamal are unable to make a convincing case about the overall crime and jamal s involvement with the murder of a police officer disagreements about the trial process some believe that abu jamal did not receive a fair trial in the courtroom proceeding that produced his first degree murder conviction concerning the judge albert f sabo was the presiding judge for the trial jamal s supporters claim that sabo had a reputation in favor of the police and against defendants in criminal cases sabo had a reputation as a judge with a bias toward convictions amnesty international claims he has sentenced more men to die three one total only two of them white than any other sitting judge in pennsylvania a review of the court records by the philadelphia inquirer showed that most of the homicide judges in philadelphia hear more murder cases than judge sabo with fewer death sentences every ruling sabo made was against jamal every objection by the prosecutors was sustained and every objection by the defense was overruled causing many to doubt sabo s impartiality a white court stenographer terri mauer carter alleged in an affidavit dated august two zero zero one that she and her boss richard klein a philadelphia judge overheard sabo saying he was going to help them fry the nigger shortly before the start of abu jamal s trial there has to date been no corroboration of this charge sabo was a philadelphia judge whose assigned cases included crimes in all of philadelphia not just a heavily non white district however jamal supporters note that this high conviction high death sentencing judge was assigned a disproportionate share of minority defendants jamal supporters contend that the reason sabo changed his mind about permitting mumia to defend himself was that jamal was actually effective in defending himself and argue further that this was typical of sabo s bias against jamal jamal s detractors answer that the claim that sabo has given more death sentences than anyone else is fabricated no such statistics are collected and so there is no way abu jamal s supporters could know this it is the jury not the judge which convicts and gives death sentences sabo presided over a heavily non white district which accounts for the racial make up of his defendants concerning mumia s defense lawyer anthony jackson was chosen by abu jamal as legal counsel after recommendation by his friends at the black journalists association jackson knew jamal before the murder he then petitioned the court to have the case assigned to him at public expense to which the court agreed afterwards jamal asked to represent himself to which judge sabo agreed however after what the court considered disruptive actions according to court records jamal was removed one three times from the courtroom for his disruptive behaviour jamal was warned that he would lose that right if he did not stop when jamal s behaviour continued jackson was reinstated as the defense lawyer jamal repeatedly asked to be represented by or at least assisted by john africa who had also been noted for his disruptive courtroom behaviour john africa having no legal training the court refused jamal objected to jackson and refused to cooperate with him saying he was functioning for the court system not for jamal and that john africa not jackson was his real counsel jackson later alleged that jamal didn t return to him some of the documents such as witness statements he had handed him when jamal took over the defense mumia s defenders often describe this as a case where a public defender is thrust upon an indigent defendant as happens in many cases and say that he was picked by sabo without jamal s consent specifically because he was not a very good lawyer jamal supporters claim that jackson would later be disbarred for incompetence although jackson is sometimes described by mumia s defenders as having never defended a client in a murder case he had served in twenty murder cases with only six convictions and no executions prior to the abu jamal case it is sometimes claimed jackson was allowed only one five zero zero to analyze evidence and to hire expert witnesses though receipts indicate that the defense spent one three zero zero zero concerning the jury the racial composition of the jury was not recorded but it is known at least two jurors were black one three of the jury as was a third accepted by the prosecution who was later dismissed for violating sequestration the racial composition of philadelphia at the time was four zero black it is sometimes claimed that the prosecution requested the removal of many black potential jurors specifically because they were black both prosecution and defense were allowed up to twenty peremptory challenges and the prosecution used fifteen of these giving reasons for each the pennsylvania supreme court which reviewed the case twice did not conclude that racial bias was a factor in jury selection which would have been grounds to order a new trial other points abu jamal s supporters claim that when the pennsylvania supreme court first upheld abu jamal s conviction in one nine eight nine that ruling found no impropriety in the prosecutor using abu jamal s teenage membership in the black panther party to claim he harbored a desire to kill a police officer for over a decade despite abu jamal having no criminal record later federal district court judge yohn threw out the death sentence because of sabo s incorrect instructions to the jury on just this point witness accounts eyewitnesses william cook mumia s brother driving the volkswagen pulled over by faulkner robert chobert cab driver i saw jamal standing over faulkner and firing some more shots into him cynthia white abu jamal came running out of the parking lot on locust street he had a handgun in his hand he fired the gun at the police officer about four or five times the police officer fell to the ground i started screaming jamal supporters claim that white was a prostitute who had been indicted and was threatened with prison if she testified in favor of jamal while if she testified against jamal she would be able to continue her prostitution without police interference robert harkins alber magilton michael scanlon other witnesses deborah kordansky veronica jones desie hightower jamal opponents have produced a map with the witness locations here robert chobert s testimony according to robert chobert s testimony and statements he was writing in his logbook when he heard the first shot and looked up he had to look over or past faulkner s car with its flashing red dome light to see the incident and saw the shooter only in profile chobert testified at trial that when he looked up he saw faulkner fall and then saw abu jamal standing over him and firing some more shots into him under cross examination by jackson he stated i know who shot the cop and i ain t going to forget it jamal supporters note chobert s first recorded statement to police about which the jury was not told was that the shooter apparently ran away according to a report written on one zero december one nine eight one by inspector giordano giordano encountered chobert upon reaching the scene about five minutes after the shooting giordano wrote a white male from the crowd stated that he saw the shooting and that a black move member had done it and apparently ran away when asked what he meant by a move member the white male stated his hair his hair apparently referring to dreadlocks there are also discrepancies between chobert s description of the shooter s clothes and weight and that of abu jamal jamal supporters claim chobert was under indictment for arson at the time and his change of testimony may have been influenced by the charges pending against him confession at the hospital when jamal was brought to jefferson hospital on the night of the killing he struggled a moment with the police outside the emergency room entrance at that time several witnesses claim to have heard him shout i shot the mother fucker and i hope the mother fucker dies he then refused medical treatment and wasn t treated until a judge had issued a court order several hours later at which time he was almost comatose while the two police officers present gary bell and gary wakshul did not write anything concerning the alleged confession in their police report a hospital security guard priscilla durham allegedly made a report to the hospital authorities the following day including that statement while she was an acquaintance of officer faulkner she claims not to have known at that time who the man being brought in was officer bell and ms durham testified during the trial wakshul however was not heard until the one nine nine five hearings but had allegedly made a written statement concerning the confession however the document produced in court was a typed transcript of the alleged report which did not bear her signature jamal s defense had originally not put wakshul on their witness list however on the last day of the trial the defense asked to hear wakshul by that time wakshul who had stayed around during the first week of the trial was on vacation judge sabo refused to extend the trial refused to try to contact wakshul claiming he was unavailable and told the defense lawyer jackson that he goofed it turns out wakshul was in fact in town and reachable at his residence the defense lawyer claimed wakshul s testimony was crucial to the case a brady witness in the one nine nine five hearings wakshul testified that he had indeed heard jamal confess to the murder and claimed that if he had written in his report the negro male made no comments and made no mention of the statement until about two months afterwards it was because of the great stress of seeing his partner die officer bell had given a similar explanation during the trial jamal s supporters have argued that his background as a journalist made it unlikely that he d make such an incriminating comment and that stress and anguish at the death of a partner is all the more reason to recognize the importance of incriminating statements stress and anguish might be likely to cause a report to be forgotten but since the report was filled out supporters argue that the clearly negative statement the negro male made no comments puts a serious dent in the credibility of the alleged confession the defense has since obtained a signed affidavit from william pate a half brother of now deceased pricilla durham stating that durham knowingly gave false testimony to incriminate jamal under police pressure objections jamal supporters argue several of the witnesses such as pamela jenkins report being forced to tear up their witness statements and instead sign statements incriminating abu jamal at the scene jenkins was the lover and informant of philadelphia police officer tom ryan in her statement jenkins claimed that ryan wanted me to perjure myself and say that i had seen jamal shoot the police officer in one nine nine six tom ryan and five other officers from the same district went to prison after being convicted of charges of planting evidence stealing money from suspects and making false reports their convictions resulted in the release of numerous prisoners implicated by the officers veronica jones witnessed the killing and testified for the defense she claimed she had been offered inducements by the police to testify that she saw abu jamal kill faulkner stating that they the police were trying to get me to say something the other girl white said i couldn t do that jones went on to testify that they the police told us we could work the area as prostitutes if we tell them that abu jamal was the shooter however judge sabo had the jury removed for this testimony and then ruled that jones statements were inadmissible evidence conflicting testimony and missing witnesses abu jamal s lawyers contend that a number of witnesses changed their original statements regarding what they saw on the night of the crime after being coerced threatened or offered inducements by the police cynthia white was collected by police and brought to the police station on three occasions in the weeks following the murder and her deposition evolved steadily in favor of the prosecution over the course of these three sessions robert chobert whose testimony also shows a drastic evolution from his initial statement to police that the killer had run away could not corroborate the presence of cynthia white at the crime scene and she could not corroborate his even though their testimonies had them within the same small stretch of sidewalk supporters also refer to the fearless witness syndrome which both chobert and white seem to exhibit via their testimony with the killing of a police officer allegedly a few paces away from them they did not seek cover but allegedly observed everything with an attention for detail that defies credibility supporters argue that the natural reaction for chobert would have been to duck beneath the dashboard of his cab once he realized shots were being fired only paces away and that cynthia white with the street smarts of a life lived in philadelphia s underworld would not have stood around on the sidewalk a stone s throw from the shooting merely observing all these factors lend credence to the testimony and affidavits later collected by the defense which point to chobert and white lying about their proximity to the crime michael scanlan the most credible of all witnesses and a witness for the prosecution cleary testified that there was no taxi parked where chobert claims his taxi was when the shooting occured william cook william cook abu jamal s brother and an obvious eyewitness to the killing did not testify for either side at trial he was convicted in separate proceedings of assaulting faulkner cook made a statement to the police on the night of the shooting and another to abu jamal s legal team in one nine nine five however neither of these statements have been seen by amnesty international abu jamal s supporters have alleged that in one nine eight two cook was being intimidated by the police and feared being charged in connection with the killing and was therefore too frightened to testify cook was scheduled to testify during the one nine nine five hearing but failed to appear again it was alleged that this was due to fear of the police and of being arrested on unrelated charges in court in his written denial of the one nine nine five appeal judge sabo made negative assumptions regarding cook s unwillingness to testify since one nine nine five the defense team has been unable to locate cook despite numerous attempts arnold beverley another man arnold beverley confessed to the murder of daniel faulkner in one nine nine nine however neither jamal nor a single prosecution or defense witness could place beverly at the scene of the crime and his account of the killing is at odds with the known facts on numerous points the jamal legal team also waited nearly twenty years before attempting to enter beverly s story as evidence into a possible retrial jamal s detractors also point out that it is common in high profile murder cases for false confessions to be made to police other points to date critics charge that neither jamal nor his supporters have given a convincing alibi for his presence at the scene of the crime with what may have been the murder weapon disagreements about ballistics gun caliber abu jamal s gun was a three eight caliber weapon and dr paul hoyer who performed the autopsy wrote in his notes that the bullet removed from faulkner s body was four four cal however he testified that this was merely a guess he made before actually performing the autopsy and this guess was not included in the autopsy report as he had no ballistics training the court accepted dr hoyer as a ballistics expert however during the one nine nine five pcra post conviction relief act hearing judge sabo contended that the medical examiner was not a ballistics expert like the two ballistics experts including jamal s own who have since testified the bullets removed from officer faulkner were consistent with being fired from the three eight caliber charter arms revolver which was registered to jamal and found at the scene the incorrect guess may be explained by the fact that the bullet was a p which leaves a larger wound mumia s supporters also claim that the discrepancy between dr hoyer s notes and mumia s gun caliber was never made known to the jury other points mumia s supporters claim that the prosecution maintained that officer faulkner turned and fired at abu jamal as he fell to the ground after being shot therefore the entry of the bullet into abu jamal should have been on a level or upward trajectory however according to the medical records the overall pathway of the bullet was downwards appeals international response and prison life abu jamal s conviction has been upheld in both state and federal courts in december two zero zero one a federal judge affirmed his murder conviction but ordered that abu jamal should either receive a new sentencing hearing or have his sentence commuted to life in prison because of an error by the trial judge in presenting rules of sentencing to the jury this decision was appealed by both sides and as of august two zero zero five the appeal is still pending in october two zero zero three mumia abu jamal was awarded the status of honorary citizen of paris in a ceremony attended by former black panther angela davis the mayor of paris bertrand delano said in a press release that the award was meant to be a reminder of the continuing fight against the death penalty which was abolished in france in one nine eight one the proposal to make abu jamal an honorary citizen was approved by the city s council in two zero zero one in addition organizations ranging from amnesty international the european parliament and the japanese diet to several national u s trade union federations ilwu afscme seiu the national postal union and the one eight million member california labor federation have declared the original trial unfair and either demand a new trial or abu jamal s immediate release human rights watch has voiced concerns about the fairness of his trial particularly what they viewed as a heavy reliance during the sentencing phase on information regarding his political beliefs and associations according to amnesty international s website while they are not in a position to say whether mumia abu jamal is innocent or guilty they have concluded that the proceedings used to convict and sentence mumia abu jamal to death were in violation of minimum international standards that govern fair trial procedures and the use of the death penalty amnesty international is against the death penalty in all cases free mumia is a popular chant of black civil rights movements since his imprisonment abu jamal has continued his political activism publishing live from death row a book on life inside prisons as well as making frequent commentaries on radio shows while in prison abu jamal completed his bachelor of arts from goddard college and earned a master of arts from california state university dominguez hills both by distance education anti flag a u s peace punk band have written a song called free mumia additionally the song voice of the voiceless by rage against the machine supports the movement for jamal s exoneration with such lyrics as my panther my brother we are at war until you re free krs one performed a song on his self titled cd free mumia he has recently endorsed rapper immortal technique and appears on his album revolutionary vol two several times he calls it truth in the form of hip hop jamal s opponents note that a december nine one nine nine eight episode of the abc news program two zero two zero claimed that the results of their four month investigation was that jamal did receive a fair trial and that many if not all of the arguments made by his supporters are based on incomplete information or information that is blatantly false however jamal s supporters contend that two zero two zero had a strong bias against jamal a witness who testified in favor of jamal jenkins was discredited by two zero two zero because she was a prostitute but the fact that a key witness who testified against jamal white was also a prostitute was

convictions prisoners serving life sentences american murderers in number theory a multiplicative function is an arithmetic function f n of the positive integer n with the property that f one one and whenever a and b are coprime then f ab f a f b an arithmetic function f n is said to be completely totally multiplicative if f one one and f ab f a f b holds for all positive integers a and b even when they are not coprime outside number theory the term multiplicative is usually used for functions with the property f ab f a f b for all arguments a and b this requires either f one one or f a zero for all a except a one this article discusses number theoretic multiplicative functions examples examples of multiplicative functions include many functions of importance in number theory such as phi n euler s totient function phi counting the positive integers coprime to but not bigger than n mu n the m bius function related to the number of prime factors of square free numbers gcd n k the greatest common divisor of n and k where k is a fixed integer d n the number of positive divisors of n sigma n the sum of all the positive divisors of n sigma k n the divisor function which is the sum of the k th powers of all the positive divisors of n where k may be any complex number in special cases we have sigma zero n d n and sigma one n sigma n one n the constant function defined by one n one completely multiplicative id n identity function defined by id n n completely multiplicative id k n the power functions defined by id k n n k for any natural or even complex number k completely multiplicative as special cases we have id zero n one n and id one n id n epsilon n the function defined by epsilon n one if n one and zero if n one sometimes called multiplication unit for dirichlet convolution or simply the unit function sometimes written as u n not to be confused with mu n completely multiplicative n p the legendre symbol where p is a fixed prime number completely multiplicative lambda n the liouville function related to the number of prime factors dividing n completely multiplicative gamma n defined by gamma n one omega n where the additive function omega n is the number of distinct primes dividing n all dirichlet characters are completely multiplicative functions an example of a non multiplicative function is the arithmetic function r two n the number of representations of n as a sum of squares of two integers positive negative or zero where in counting the number of ways reversal of order is allowed for example one one two zero two one two zero two zero two one two zero two one two and therefore r two one four one this shows that the function is not multiplicative however r two n four is multiplicative in the on line encyclopedia of integer sequences sequences of values of a multiplicative function have the keyword mult see arithmetic function for some other examples of non multiplicative functions properties a multiplicative function is completely determined by its values at the powers of prime numbers a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic thus if n is a product of powers of distinct primes say n p a q b then f n f p a f q b this property of multiplicative functions significantly reduces the need for computation as in the following examples for n one four four two four three two d one four four sigma zero one four four sigma zero two four sigma zero three two one zero two zero four zero eight zero one six zero one zero three zero nine zero five three one five sigma one four four sigma one one four four sigma one two four sigma one three two one one two one four one eight one one six one one one three one nine one three one one three four zero three sigma one four four sigma two four sigma three two one one one six one one one nine one one seven one zero one seven zero similarly we have phi one four four phi two four phi three two eight six four eight in general if f n is a multiplicative function and a b are any two positive integers then f a f b f gcd a b f lcm a b every completely multiplicative function is a homomorphism of monoids and is completely determined by its restriction to the prime numbers convolution if f and g are two multiplicative functions one defines a new multiplicative function f g the dirichlet convolution of f and g by f g n d n f d g n d where the sum extends over all positive divisors d of n with this operation the set of all multiplicative functions turns into an abelian group the identity element is epsilon relations among the multiplicative functions discussed above include epsilon mu one the m bius inversion formula phi mu id d one one sigma id one phi d sigma k id k one id phi one sigma mu id k sigma k mu the dirichlet convolution can be defined

layer two mpeg two one nine nine four is the designation for a group of coding standards for digital audio and video agreed upon by mpeg moving pictures experts group and published as the iso iec one three eight one eight international standard mpeg two is typically used to encode audio and video for broadcast signals including direct broadcast satellite and cable tv mpeg two with some modifications is also the coding format used by standard commercial dvd movies mpeg two includes a systems part part one that defines transport streams which are designed to carry digital video and audio over somewhat unreliable media and are used in broadcast applications the video part part two of mpeg two is similar to mpeg one but also provides support for interlaced video the format used by broadcast tv systems mpeg two video is not optimized for low bit rates less than one mbit s but outperforms mpeg one at three mbit s and above all standards conforming mpeg two video decoders are fully capable of playing back mpeg one video streams with some enhancements mpeg two video and systems are also used in most hdtv transmission systems the mpeg two audio part defined in part three of the standard enhances mpeg one s audio by allowing the coding of audio programs with more than two channels part three of the standard allows this to be done in a backwards compatible way allowing mpeg one audio decoders to decode the two main stereo components of the presentation in part seven of the mpeg two standard audio can alternatively be coded in a non backwards compatible way which allows encoders to make better use of available bandwidth part seven is referred to as mpeg two aac the standard general information about mpeg two video and audio and systems excluding modifications when used on dvd dvb a mpeg two program stream typically consists of two elements video data time stamps audio data time stamps video coding simplified mpeg two is for the generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio and creates a video stream out of three types of frame data intra frames forward predictive frames and bidirectional predicted frames that can be arranged in a specified order called the gop structure gop group of pictures see below actually the standard itself does not define or use the term gop except in the name of a syntax structure called a gop header however users of mpeg two have found that the gop concept helps convey a basic understanding of the standard typically the originating material is a video sequence at a pre set pixel resolution at two five ccir or approximately two nine nine seven fcc frames second with sound mpeg two supports both interlaced and progressive scan video streams in progressive scan streams the basic unit of encoding is a frame while in interlaced streams the basic unit may be either a field or a frame in the discussion below the generic terms picture and image refer to either fields or frames depending on the type of stream an mpeg two video bitstream is made up of a series of data frames encoding pictures the three ways of encoding a picture are intra coded i picture forward predictive p picture and bidirectional predictive b picture the video image is separated into one luminance y and two chrominance channels also called color difference signals cb and cr blocks of the luminance and chrominance arrays are organized into macroblocks which are the basic unit of coding within a picture each macroblock is divided into four eight eight luminance blocks the number of eight eight chrominance blocks per macroblock depends on the chrominance format of the source image for example in the common four two zero format there is one chrominance block per macroblock for each of the two chrominance channels making a total of six blocks per macroblock in the case of i pictures the actual image data is then passed through the encoding process described below p and b pictures are first subjected to a process of motion compensation in which they are predicted from the previous and in the case of b pictures the next image in time order each macroblock in the p or b picture is associated with an area in the previous or next image that is well correlated with it as selected by the encoder using a motion vector the motion vector that maps the macroblock to its correlated area is encoded and then the difference between the two areas is passed through the encoding process described below each block is treated with an eight x eight discrete cosine transform the resulting dct coefficients are then quantized re ordered to maximize the probability of long runs of zeros and low amplitudes of subsequent values and then run length coded finally a fixed table huffman encoding scheme is applied i pictures encode for spatial redundancy p and b pictures for temporal redundancy because adjacent frames in a video stream are often well correlated p pictures may be one zero of the size of i pictures and b pictures two of their size the sequence of different frame types is called the group of pictures gop structure there are many possible structures but a common one is one five frames long and has the sequence i bb p bb p bb p bb p bb a similar one two frame sequence is also common the ratio of i p and b pictures in the gop structure is determined by the nature of the video stream and the bandwidth constraints on the output stream although encoding time may also be an issue this is particularly true in live transmission and in real time environments with limited computing resources as a stream containing many b pictures can take three times longer to encode than an i picture only file the output bit rate of an mpeg two encoder can be constant or variable with the maximum bit rate determined by the playback media for example the dvd movie maximum is one zero four mbit s to achieve a constant bit rate the degree of quantization is iteratively altered to achieve the output bit rate requirement increasing quantization leads to visible artifacts when the stream is decoded generally in the form of mosaicing where the discontinuities at the edges of macroblocks become more visible as bit rate is reduced mpeg video compression also defines dc pictures d pictures which are similar to i pictures but include only the dc value of each block a system can use a stream of only d pictures to support rapid searching through another stream audio encoding mpeg two also introduces new audio encoding methods these are low bitrate encoding with halved sampling rate mpeg one layer

meditations on first philosophy meditation is the practice of focusing the mind often formalized into a specific routine meditation is usually recognized as a component of eastern religions originating in vedic hinduism but it also developed independently in sufism meditation can also be used for personal development in a non religious context such as the exercises of hatha yoga a large statue in bangalore depicting shiva meditating overview the english word meditation comes from the latin meditatio which originally indicated every type of physical or intellectual exercise then later evolved into the more specific meaning contemplation this usage is found in christian spirituality for example meditations on the sufferings of christ as well as western philosophy as in descartes meditations on first philosophy a set of six mental exercises which systematically analyze the nature of reality however meditation in its modern sense also refers to a separate practice unrelated to christian meditations in the late nineteenth century theosophists adopted the word meditation to refer to various spiritual practices drawn from hinduism buddhism and other eastern religions thus the english word meditation does not exclusively translate any single term or concept and can be used to translate words such as the sanskrit dhyana samadhi or pranayama meditation is usually defined as one of the following a state that is experienced when the mind dissolves and is free of all thoughts focusing the mind on a single object such as a religious statue or one s breath or a mantra a mental opening up to the divine invoking the guidance of a higher power reasoned analysis of religious teachings such as impermanence for buddhists its ritual and contemplative qualities are similar to prayer in western religions but prayer emphasizes communication with a higher being whereas meditation focuses on developing oneself meditation may be for a religious purpose but even before being brought to the west it was used in secular contexts such as the martial arts beginning with the theosophists though meditation has been employed by a number of religious movements such as hatha yoga and the new age movement as well as limited use in christianity it has been suggested that the recent popularity of meditation as a religious practice in the west signals some discomfort with more traditional christian and jewish practices such as prayer others see meditation and prayer as harmonious edgar cayce taught that through prayer we speak to god in meditation god speaks to us from the point of view of psychology meditation can induce an altered state of consciousness however many religious people would challenge the assumption that such mental states or any other visible result are the goal of meditation the goals of meditation are varied and range from spiritual enlightenment to the transformation of attitudes to better cardiovascular health it is easy to observe that our minds are continually thinking about the past memories and the future expectations with intention it is possible to slow down the mind we are able to observe a mental silence also called experience of the present moment this is a subjective sense of being connected with the universality of being meditation is the method one may follow to verify this experience it is an experiential means of separating thoughts from the part of our consciousness which perceives the thoughts the observer by disengaging our mind we are able to observe the more subtle details and gain better control over what we give attention to the experience of thoughts winding down and stopping is also known as timeless awareness types of meditation gathering the light taoist meditation from the secret of the golden flower by c g jung and richard wilhelm according to perez de albeniz others focus on a preselected specific object and are called concentrative meditation there are also techniques that shift between the field and the object categorizing the varieties of meditation is difficult one common way is according to religion or lineage but some meditative traditions such as yoga or tantra are common to several religions or occur outside religious contexts therefore to avoid controversy this article will not attempt to classify all meditations into a religious class or lineage buddhism meditation has always enjoyed a central place within buddhism the buddha himself was said to have achieved enlightenment while meditating under a bodhi tree most forms of buddhism distinguish between samatha and vipassana meditation both of which are necessary for enlightenment the former consists of learning to focus the attention single pointedly the latter involves seeing the true nature of reality theravada buddhism emphasizes vipassana meditation directed towards anapana mett bh van or three eight other traditional topics see kammatthana in japanese mahayana schools tendai tien tai concentration is cultivated through highly structured ritual especially in the chinese chan buddhism school which branched out into the japanese zen and korean seon schools ts o ch an meditation and kung an meditation practices are extremely important and considered a necessity for enlightenment each of the names of these schools derives from the sanskrit dhyana and translates into meditation in their respective languages the esoteric shingon sect shares many features with tibetan buddhism tibetan buddhism emphasizes tantra for its senior practitioners hence its alternate name of vajrayana buddhism however visitors to tibetan monasteries are often surprised to discover that many monks go through their day without meditating in a recognizable form but are more likely to chant or participate in group liturgy christianity christian traditions have various practices which might be identified as forms of meditation many of these are monastic practices some types of christian prayer such as the rosary in catholicism or the hesychasm in eastern orthodoxy may be compared to the form of eastern meditation that focuses on an individual object but these comparisons often overlook the importance of prayer in these rituals judaism the explicit concept of meditation or in depth contemplation hebrew hitbonenut can be found in kabbalah and hassidic judaism hinduism there are several types of meditation in hinduism vedanta is a form of jnana yoga raja yoga as outlined by patanjali describes eight limbs of spiritual practices half of which might be classified as meditation underlying them is the assumption that a yogi should still the fluctuations of his or her mind yoga cittavrrti nirodha sant mat teaches sound and light meditation surat shabd yoga osho taught a wide variety of meditative techniques including a laughing meditation islam within islam meditation refers to the sufi practice of muraqaba similar forms of meditative ritual in sufism include dhikr recitation of the divine names sema whirling and devotional music such as qawwali sikhism in sikhism the practices of simran and n m jap encourage quiet meditation taoism taoism includes a number of meditative and contemplative traditions originally said to have their principles described in the i ching tao te ching chuang tzu and tao tsang among other texts the multitude of schools relating to qigong neigong daoyin and zhan zhuang are a large diverse array of breath training practises in aid of meditation with much influence from later chinese buddhism and with much influence on traditional chinese medicine and the chinese as well as some japanese martial arts the chinese martial art t ai chi ch uan is named after the well known focus for taoist and neo confucian meditation the t ai chi t u and is often referred to as meditation in motion transcendental meditation transcendental meditation is a modern form of meditation invented by maharishi mahesh yogi an indian spiritual teacher it is grounded in vedantic hinduism but also has its own innovations transcendental meditation is based on a mantra which is given to the practitioner by the teacher meditation in context most traditions address the integration of mind body and spirit this is a major theme of the bhagavad gita or that of spiritual practice with family life work and so on often meditation is said to be incomplete if it doesn t lead to positive changes in one s daily life and attitudes in that spirit some zen practitioners have promoted zen driving aimed at reducing road rage meditation is often presented not as a free standing activity but as one part of a wider spiritual tradition nevertheless many meditators today do not follow an organized religion or do not consider themselves to do so faithfully religious authorities typically insist that spiritual practices such as meditation belong in the context of a well rounded religious life that may include ritual or liturgy scriptural study and the observance of religious laws or regulations perhaps the most widely cited spiritual prerequisite for meditation is an ethical lifestyle many martial arts teachers urge their students to respect parents and teachers and inculcate other positive values some traditions incorporate crazy wisdom or intentionally transgressive acts in their sacred lore if not in actual practice sufi poets e g rumi hafiz celebrate the virtues of wine which is forbidden in islam though one could argue that the poets are speaking metaphorically some tantrikas indulge in the five forbidden things that begin with the letter m most meditative traditions discourage drug use exceptions include some forms of hinduism which have a long tradition of hashish or marijuana using renunciates and certain native american traditions which use peyote ayahuasca or other restricted substances in a religious setting a number of meditative traditions requires permission from a teacher or elder who in turn has received permission from another teacher and so on in a lineage most chinese traditions rely on the confucian concept of a sifu hinduism and buddhism stress the importance of a spiritual teacher sanskrit guru tibetan lama orthodox christianity has spiritual elders greek gerontas russian starets catholic religious have spiritual directors the immediate meditative environment is often held to be important several traditions incorporate cleansing rituals for the place where one meditates and others offer instructions for an altar or other accessories physical postures cross legged posture see also lotus position different spiritual traditions and different teachers within those traditions prescribe or suggest different physical postures for meditation most famous are the several cross legged postures including the so called lotus position for example the dalai lama recommends the seven points of vairocana in which the legs are crossed in either the lotus position here called the vajra position or the other way indian or tailor fashion here called the bodhisattva position the eyes are kept open thus affirming the world the back is kept straight like an arrow or a stack of coins the shoulders are kept even and relaxed the gaze is kept at a medium level too low and one becomes drowsy too high and one becomes restless the mouth is kept slightly open the tongue touches the roof of the mouth many meditative traditions teach that the spine should be kept straight i e that the meditator should not slouch often this is explained as a way of encouraging the circulation of what we might call spiritual energy the vital breath or the life force sanskrit prana chinese qi latin spiritus in some traditions the meditator may sit on a western chair flat footed as in new thought sit on a stool as in orthodox christianity or walk in mindfulness as in theravada buddhism various hand gestures or mudras may be prescribed these can carry theological meaning or according to yogic philosophy can actually affect consiousness for example a common buddhist hand position is with the right hand resting atop the left like the buddha s begging bowl with the thumbs touching quiet is often held to be desirable and some people use repetitive activities such as deep breathing humming or chanting to help induce a meditative state the tibetan tradition described above is probably in the minority for recommending that the eyes remain open practitioners of the soto zen tradition also meditate with their eyes open facing a wall but most schools of meditation assume that the eyes will be closed often such details are shared by more than one religion even in cases where mutual influence seems unlikely one example would be navel gazing which is apparently attested within eastern orthodoxy as well as chinese qigong practice another would be the practice of focusing on the breath which is found in orthodox christianity sufism and numerous indic traditions sitting cross legged or upon one s knees for extended periods when one is not sufficiently limber can result in a range of ergonomic complaints called meditator s knee frequency and duration these vary so much that it is difficult to venture any general comments on one extreme there exist monks and nuns whose whole lives are ordered around meditation on the other hand one minute meditations are not out of the question twenty or thirty minutes is probably a typical duration experienced meditators often find their sessions growing in length of their own accord observing the advice and instructions of one s spiritual teacher is generally held to be most beneficial many traditions stress regular practice accordingly many meditators experience guilt or frustration upon failing to do so possible responses range from perseverance to acceptance purposes and effects of meditation the purposes for which people meditate vary almost as widely as practices meditation may serve simply as a means of relaxation from a busy daily routine as a technique for cultivating mental discipline or as a means of gaining insight into the nature of reality or of communing with one s god many report improved concentration awareness self discipline and equanimity through meditation many authorities avoid emphasizing the effects of meditation sometimes out of modesty sometimes for fear that the expectation of results might interfere with one s meditation for theists the effects of meditation are considered a gift of god or from the holy spirit ghost and not something that is achieved by the meditator alone just as some say that a person will not convert to christianity without the influence of the holy spirit ghost s presence at the same time many effects or perhaps side effects have been experienced during or claimed for various types of meditation these include greater faith in or understanding of one s religion or beliefs an increase in patience compassion and other virtues and morals or the understanding of them feelings of calm or peace and or moments of great joy consciousness of sin temptation and remorse and a spirit of contrition sensitivity to certain forms of lighting such as fluorescent lights or computer screens and sometimes heightened sense perception surfacing of buried memories possibly including memories of previous lives and those of others or that of those to come experience of spiritual phenomena such as kundalini extra sensory perception or visions of deities saints demons etc miraculous abilities such as levitation cf yogic flying psychotic episodes see medical section below some traditions acknowledge that many types of experiences and effects are possible but instruct the meditator to keep in mind the spiritual purpose of the meditation and not be distracted by lesser concerns for example mahayana buddhists are urged to meditate for the sake of full and perfect enlightenment for all sentient beings the bodhisattva vow some as in certain sects of christianity say that these things are possible but are only to be supported if they are to the glory of god metta meditation the practice of loving kindness the pali word metta is commonly translated in english as loving kindness metta signifies friendship and non violence as well as a strong wish for the happiness of others though it refers to many seemingly disparate ideas metta is in fact a very specific form of love a caring for another independent of all self interest and thus is likened to one s love for one s child or parent understandably this energy is often difficult to describe in words however in the practice of metta meditation one recites specific words and phrases in order to evoke this boundless warm hearted feeling the strength of this feeling is not limited to or by family religion or social class indeed metta is a tool that permits one s generosity and kindness to be applied to all beings and as a consequence one finds true happiness in another person s happiness no matter who the individual is health applications and clinical studies of meditation scenes of inner taksang temple hall built just above the cave where padmasambhava meditated in the

awareness or flow one theory presented by daniel goleman perez de albeniz perez de albeniz metzner two zero zero five meditation and drugs some modern methods of meditation do not include the use of drugs due to the known health problems associated with drug use however the use of stimulants has been proposed by some as a means to provide insight and in some shamanistic traditions they are used as agents of ritual some native american traditions for instance emphasized the smoking of a pipe containing tobacco or other plants some hindu traditions use bhang east asian traditions use tea and middle eastern and many western religions use coffee as an aid to meditation during the one nine six zero s eastern meditation traditions and lsd became popular among many people and many people suggested that lsd use and meditation were both means to the same spiritual existential end however many people who had already been familiar with eastern traditions rejected this idea including many who had tried lsd themselves in the master game de ropp said that the door to full consciousness could be glimpsed through with the aid of substances yet to pass beyond the door required yoga and

mpeg four introduced in late one nine nine eight is the designation for a group of audio and video coding standards and related technology agreed upon by the iso iec moving picture experts group mpeg the primary uses for the mpeg four standard are web streaming media and cd distribution conversational videophone and broadcast television mpeg four absorbs many of the features of mpeg one and mpeg

specified digital rights management and various types of interactivity most of the features included in mpeg four are left to individual developers to decide whether to implement them this means that there are probably no complete implementations of the entire mpeg four set of standards to deal with this the standard includes the concept of profiles and levels allowing a specific set of capabilities to be defined in a manner appropriate for a subset of applications mpeg four parts mpeg four consists of several standards termed parts including the following part one iso iec one four

the study of vessels shore side facilities cargoes and human remains one speciality is underwater archaeology which studies the past through any submerged remains another specialty within maritime archaeology is nautical archaeology which studies vessel construction and use maritime archaeology can be divided in a three tier hierarchy of which the first tier consists of the archaeology of shipwrecks and wreck sites in this discipline the wrecking process itself is studied how does a ship break up how does a ship sink to the bottom and how do the remains of both ship and cargo decay over time the second tier studies the ship as a machine both in itself and in a military or economic system the third tier consists of the archaeology of maritime cultures in which nautical technology naval warfare trade and shipboard societies are studied maritime archaeology has three important differences from land archaeology first the remains of ships and cargoes even organic materials are sometimes better preserved under water or in bottom sediments especially in freshwater anaerobic environments a second difference lies in the fact that until recently shipwrecks were usually beyond the reach of human intervention or marine salvage thereby preventing looters from destroying the site a third difference comes from the fact that shipwrecks represent a moment in time rather than a slow deposition of material accumulated over a period of years this fact has lead to shipwrecks being described as time capsules famous shipwrecks uluburun late bronze age shipwreck one four th

of music that share a certain style or basic musical language van der merwe one nine eight nine p three music can also be categorised by non musical criteria such as geographical origin such categories are not strictly genre and a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of sub genres categorizing music especially into finer genres or subgenres can be difficult for newly emerging styles or for pieces of music that incorporate features of multiple genres attempts to pigeonhole particular musicians in a single genre are sometimes ill founded as they may produce music in a variety of genres over time or even within a single piece some people feel that the categorization of music into genres is based more on commercial and marketing motives than musical criteria john zorn for example a musician whose work has covered a wide range of genres wrote in arcana musicians on music that genres are tools used to commodify and commercialize an artist s complex personal vision others contend that it is actually the artist who chooses knowingly or not to create an artistic work that can be easily classified within a genre these contentions are not mutually exclusive some say there is a tradeoff in which most artists seek individual expression as well as the approval acceptance of an audience and audiences like any group of human beings prefer to identify themselves with the things they love hence the need for a label some genre labels are quite vague and may be contrived by critics post rock for example is a term devised and defined by simon reynolds another example of this is video game music which while defined by its media can also represent its own style as well as that of any other musical genre categorizing music by genre does make it easier to trace threads through music history and makes it easier for individuals to find artists that they enjoy moreover the use of genre labels may actually drive the development of new music especially in a commercial context insofar as it helps cultivate the interest and participation of a target audience in the early and middle stages of a musical trend most new genre labels are aimed at the youth market who typically desire to contrast the mainstream yet conform to their peer group resulting in readily marketed fads of all kinds including music genres swing rock new wave rap and grunge are all examples of music genres in which millions of young people enjoyed being different in unison this disproportionate commercial targeting of genres towards the youth market may diminish as young people increasingly shift from being music buyers to being music downloaders with or without a purchase involved although there are many individual genres it is possible to group these together into a number of overlapping major groupings classical music or art music the term classical music refers to a number of different but related genres without any qualification the usual meaning of classical music in the english language is european classical music an older usage describes specifically the western art music of the classical music era it can also refer to the classical or art music of non western cultures such as indian classical music or chinese classical music in a western context classical music is generally a classification covering music composed and performed by professionally trained artists classical music is a written tradition it is composed and written using music notation and as a rule is performed faithfully to the score art music is a term widely used to describe classical music and other serious forms of artistic musical expression western or non western especially referring to serious music composed after one nine five zero in common usage classical music often refers to orchestral music in general regardless of when it was composed or for what purpose film scores and orchestral arrangements on pop music recordings for example gospel gospel is a musical genre characterised by dominant vocals often with strong use of harmony referencing lyrics of a religious nature particularly christian subgenres include contemporary gospel and urban contemporary gospel jazz jazz is a musical form that grew out of a cross fertilization of folk blues ragtime and european music particularly band music it has been called the first native art form to develop in the united states of america the music has gone through a series of developments since its inception in roughly chronological order they are dixieland swing big band bebop hard bop cool jazz free jazz jazz fusion and smooth jazz jazz is primarily an instrumental form of music the instrument most closely associated with jazz may be the saxophone followed closely by the trumpet the trombone piano double bass guitar and drums are also primary jazz instruments the clarinet and banjo were often used especially in the earlier styles of jazz although there have been many renowned jazz vocalists and many of the most well known jazz tunes have lyrics the majority of well known and influential jazz musicians and composers have been instrumentalists during the time of its widest popularity roughly one nine two zero to one nine five zero jazz and popular music had a very intimate connection popular songs drew upon jazz influences and many jazz hits were reworkings of popular songs or lyrics were written for jazz tunes in an attempt to create popular hits the single most distinguishing characteristic of jazz is improvisation jazz also tends to utilize complex chord structures and an advanced sense of harmony these characteristics in combination with the use of improvisation require a high degree of technical skill and musical knowledge from the performers the art form today is a widely varied one using influences from all of the past styles although the root of modern jazz is primarily bebop modern jazz can also incorporate elements of rock and roll electronica and hip hop jazz was a direct influence on rhythm and blues and therefore a secondary influence on most later genres of popular music modern american art music composers have often used elements of jazz in their compositions latin american latin american music music of mexico central america south america and the caribbean see west indies the region of latin america contains a rich variety of cultural and musical heritages including those of lowland native americans in the amazon river area and parts of central america those of highland native americans in mexico guatemala and the andes those of african americans especially in the caribbean ecuador suriname guyana french guiana coastal venezuela colombia and northeastern brazil and those of people of spanish and portuguese descent the blues the blues is a vocal and instrumental music form which emerged in the african american community of the united states blues evolved from west african spirituals work songs field hollers shouts and chants and has its earliest stylistic roots in west africa this musical form has been a major influence on later american and western popular music finding expression in ragtime jazz big bands rhythm and blues rock and roll and country music as well as conventional pop songs and even modern classical music due to its powerful influence that spawned other major musical genres originating from america blues can be regarded as the root of pop as well as american music rhythm and blues rhythm and blues is a name for black popular music tradition when speaking strictly of rhythm n blues the term may refer to black pop music from one nine four zero s to one nine six zero s that was not jazz nor blues but something more lightweight the term r often refers to any contemporary black pop music early one nine five zero s r by the one nine seven zero s funk had become its own subgenre that stressed complex funky rhythm patterns and monotonistic compositions based on a riff or two in the early to mid one nine seven zero s hip hop music also known as rap grew out of funk and reggae see below funk and soul music evolved into contemporary r this was called rockabilly in addition from swing and bluegrass emerged as a largely underground phenomenon later in the decade the nashville sound a highly polished form of country music became very popular in reaction to this harder edged gritty musicians sprung up in bakersfield california inventing the bakersfield sound merle haggard and similar artists brought the bakersfield sound to mainstream audiences in the one nine six zero s while nashville started churning out countrypolitan during the one nine seven zero s the most popular genre was outlaw country a heavily rock influenced style the late one nine eight zero s saw the urban cowboys bring about an influx of pop oriented stars during the one nine nine zero s modern bluegrass music has remained mostly traditional though progressive bluegrass and close harmony groups do exist and the sound is the primary basis for jam bands like the grateful dead electronic music electronic music started long before the invention of the synthesizer with the use of tape loops and analogue electronics in the one nine five zero s and one nine six zero s well known examples include the theme music to the tv series doctor who recorded in one nine six three by delia derbyshire and the catch all electronica which can sometimes include all of the above electronic sub genres but usually refers to electronic music without lyrics one of the first people to popularize the synthesizer was wendy carlos who performed classical music on the synthesizer on the recording switched on bach space music was popularized by the group tangerine dream among others as a precursor to new age music new age music served to support and perpetuate the values of the new age movement though there is some overlap between the various sub genres of electronic music brian eno the creator of ambient music claimed that ambient had a bit of evil in it whereas new age music did not eno s creation was less values driven than new age his goal was to create music like wallpaper insofar as the listener could listen to or easily ignore the music naturally many people have met electronic music also in the form of video game music electronic dance music although many artists in the five zero s and six zero s created pure electronic music with pop structures fully formed electronic dance music as we know it today really emerged in one nine seven seven with giorgio moroder s from here to eternity album there are now many subgenres of electronic music these include techno mechanical sounding dance music featuring little melody and more noise trance music with a distinct style of instrumentation focused on complex uplifting chord progressions and melodies goa trance spawning from industrial music and tribal dance focusing on creating psychedelic sound effects within the songs house music fully electronic disco music big beat using older drum loops and more melodic elements sampled and looped drum and bass an offshoot of hardcore and jamaican dancehall utilizing quick tempos with sampled break beats most notably the amen break and the funky drummer gabber or gabba a dutch development on techno which features extremely high tempos and lots of overdrive and distortion on the music especially the bass drum being distorted into a square wave tone happy hardcore a less confronting take on gabba fusing elements of drum and bass as well and often including sped up vocals from seven zero s pop music synthpop features strong pop songwriting melodies with roots in one nine eight zero s dance music and electro of these subgenres trance and house are probably the most widespread electronic dance music is often composed to fit easily into a live dj set electronica electronic music that does not fall into the new age techno or dance categories are often referred to as left field or electronica styles of electronica include ambient downtempo illbient and trip hop among countless others see list of electronic music genres which are all related in that they usually rely more on their atmospheric qualities than electronic dance music and make use of slower more subtle tempos sometimes excluding rhythm completely idm an abbreviation for intelligent dance music is an elusive and confusing genre classification that can only be truly defined by flagbearers and flagburners like aphex twin and autechre all electronic music owes at least its historical existence to early pioneers of tape experiments known as musique concr te such as john cage pierre schaeffer and karlheinz stockhausen as well as early synthesists like wendy carlos jean michel jarre and morton subotnick see electronic art music melodic music melodic music is a term that covers various genres of non classical music which are primarily characterised by the dominance of a single strong melody line rhythm tempo and beat are subordinate to the melody line or tune which is generally easily memorable and followed without great difficulty melodic music is found in all parts of the world overlapping many genres and may be performed by a singer or orchestra or a combination of the two in the west melodic music has developed largely from folk song sources and been heavily influenced by classical music in its development and orchestration in many areas the border line between classical and melodic popular music is imprecise opera is generally considered to be a classical form the lighter operetta is considered borderline whilst stage and film musicals and musical comedy are firmly placed in the popular melodic category the reasons for much of this are largely historical other major categories of melodic music include music hall and vaudeville which along with the ballad grew out of european folk music orchestral dance music developed from localised forms such as the jig polka and waltz but with the admixture of latin american negro blues and ragtime influences it diversified into countless sub genres such as big band cabaret and swing more specialised forms of melodic music include military music religious music also video game music is often melodic traditional pop music overlaps a number of these categories big band music and musical comedy for example are closely allied to traditional pop reggae dub and related forms in jamaica during the one nine five zero s american r the lyrics were rhythmic and rhyme heavy after the popularity of reggae died down in the early one nine eight zero s derivatives of dub dominated the jamaican charts these included ragga and dancehall both of which remained popular in jamaica alone until the mainstream breakthrough of american gangsta rap which evolved out of dub musicians like dj kool herc moving to american cities ragga especially now has many devoted followers throughout the world reggaeton is a fusion of reggae and rap popular in latin america but gradually appearing in the mainstream charts punk rock punk rock is a subgenre of rock music the term punk rock can only rarely be applied without any controversy perhaps the only bands always considered punk are the first wave of punk bands such as the clash the sex pistols and the ramones and even then they may be labeled sellouts by more hardcore fans before this however a series of underground musicians helped define the music throughout the one nine seven zero s see forerunners of punk music punk is often considered especially important for its do it yourself philosophy many punk musicians encouraged their fans and audience members to learn to play instruments and form their own bands and doing so was implicitly encouraged by the apparent simplicity of the music since punk bands were often ignored by major labels the definitions of the many sub genres and the question of which groups belong in which sub genres is often a subject of heated debate the derivative genres of punk can be roughly grouped into four general styles hardcore punk new wave post punk and alternative rock see those articles and their associated categories look near the bottom of the article pages for more information on the many styles of punk rock hip hop rap hip hop music can be seen as a subgenre of r alternative hip hop blockbuster and helped develop a specific style called jazz rap characterized by the use of live instrumentation and or jazz samples other less popular forms of hip hop include various non american varieties japan britain mexico sweden finland france germany italy and turkey have vibrant hip hop communities in puerto rico a style called reggaeton is popular electro hip hop was invented in the one nine eight zero s but is distinctly different from most old school hip hop as is go go another old style some other genres have been created by fusing hip hop with techno trip hop and heavy metal rapcore in the late one nine eight zero s miami s hip hop scene was characterized by bass heavy grooves designed for dancing miami bass music horrorcore or acid rap is mainly credited to detroit and the midwest there are also rappers with christian themes in the lyrics this is christian hip hop perhaps the most recent development in hip hop is the backpacker sub genre characterized by a renewed focus on poetry and hip hop culture it includes artists such as sage francis atmosphere and eyedea and abilities contemporary african music since the one nine six zero s most african popular music incorporates traditional local vocal instrumental and percussive styles but also draws heavily on rock reggae and or hip hop for example ra which originated in algeria and spread throughout north africa and to the north african diaspora especially in france began with topical songs based in the local traditional music but starting around one nine eight zero began to incorporate elements of hip hop other notable contemporary african genres include zulu jive south africa highlife ghana nigeria zouk cape verde soukous zaire congo and in nigeria j j music now nearly a century old and constantly evolving and afrobeat many african countries have also developed their own versions of reggae and hip hop subjectivity one of the problems with the grouping of music into genres is that it is a subjective process that has a lot to do with the individual s personal understanding and way of listening to music this is especially true in sub genres one example is led zeppelin which could be called heavy metal hard rock or blues depending on one s interpretation references van der merwe peter one nine eight nine origins of the popular style the antecedents

or simply older teacher relative to his son by some aikidoka biography morihei ueshiba was born in tanabe wakayama prefecture japan on december one four one eight eight three during his childhood the ueshiba family lived in maizuru kyoto prefecture his interest in martial arts stemmed from witnessing a beating of his father which affected him deeply however it was only after moving to the northern island of hokkaido in one nine one six with his wife as part of a settlement effort that his martial art training took on real depth for it was here that he began his study of daito ryu aiki jutsu under its reviver sokaku takeda after ueshiba left hokkaido he came under the influence of onisaburo deguchi the spiritual leader of the omoto kyo sect in ayabe in addition to his spiritual growth this connection ironically was to have a major effect in introducing ueshiba to various elite political circles as a martial artist the ueshiba dojo in ayabe was used to train members of the omoto kyo sect he was involved in the first omoto kyo incident an ill fated attempt to found a utopian colony in mongolia over time ueshiba was to distance himself from both these teachers but their effect on him and his art can not be overstated in one nine two seven ueshiba moved to tokyo where he founded his first dojo which still exists today under the name aikikai hombu dojo between one nine four zero and one nine four two he made several visits to manchukuo japanese occupied manchuria to instruct aikido in one nine four two he left tokyo and moved to iwama in the ibaraki prefecture where the term

teaching his aikido morihei ueshiba died april two six th one nine six nine legacy ueshiba sensei is remembered as a master of the martial arts whose studies transcended technical matters to include a moral and philosophical view of the world based around harmony in the face of aggression the many branches of aikido in existence today virtually all trace their lineage back to him within these various branches he is sometimes also referred to as kaiso founder or o sensei great teacher many stories exist about ueshiba s martial skill it is said for example that he was able to escape a tight ring of students that surrounded him with swords many of these students would later say they had not even seen him go by them another story is that he was able to knock someone off their feet with the force of his kiai there is debate in the aikido world over some of these sensational stories some dismiss them as myth generated around a genuinely brilliant but human martial artist whereas others believe that morihei ueshiba truly achieved such superhuman feats oomoto priests oversee a ceremony in ueshiba s honor every april two nine th at the aiki shrine at iwama ueshiba also had many

aikido in this light as a young man ueshiba was renowned for his incredible physical strength he would later lose much of this muscle which some believe changed the way he performed aikido technique ueshiba was said to be a simple but wise man and a gifted farmer in his later years he was regarded as very kind and gentle as a rule but there are also stories of terrifying scoldings delivered to his students for instance he once thoroughly chastised students for practicing jo strikes on trees without first covering them in protective padding another time as students snuck back into the dojo

the low level operation of a computer in much the same way an assembler helps prepare higher level code for a processor the difference is that the microprogram is usually only developed by the processor manufacturer and works intimately with the hardware the microprogram defines the instruction set any normal program including both application programs and operating systems is written in the use of a microprogram allows the manufacturer to fix certain mistakes including working around hardware design errors without modifiing the hardware the use of microprogram also allows the same hardware to run different instruction sets the microprogram is then loaded to a control store to become of the logic of a cpu s control unit at one time it was proposed to provide a microassmbler to certain sophisticated users so they could customize the instruct set of the computer for their special needs intending to provide more efficient instructions tuned to the end user s needs the extreme complexity of writing microcode combined with the fact that running a custom microcode prevented using commercial software resulted in this being abandoned a manual alphabet is a system of representing all the letters of an alphabet using only the hands making words using a manual alphabet is called fingerspelling manual alphabets are a part of sign languages there are two families of

automatic machine pistols appear at least as early as one nine three five today several types of weapon are variously described as either machine pistols or submachine guns such as the mac one zero

advertised and referred to as submachine guns perhaps the most obvious example is the b t mp nine formerly known as the steyr tmp though many submachine guns possess a stock and are thus capable of being fired from the shoulder akin to a rifle this is not a clearly defining feature as numerous submachine guns lack a stock and several machine pistols possess them while there is no uniform set of defining characteristics of the type being chambered for a pistol cartridge and being capable of firing more than one round per trigger pull are two of the features of a machine pistol many have a magazine contained within the grip and several have select fire capabilities machine pistols are sometimes preferred by undercover operatives for their small size and high rate of fire specialist

glock one eight a fully automatic pistol firearms personal weapons martin luther king jr january one five one nine two nine april four one nine six eight was a baptist minister and american political activist who was the most famous leader of the american civil rights movement king won the nobel peace prize before being assassinated in one nine six eight in one nine seven seven king was posthumously awarded the presidential medal of freedom by jimmy carter for his promotion of non violence and racial equality king is considered a peacemaker and martyr by many people around the world martin luther king day was established in his honor family and background king was born in atlanta georgia on auburn avenue to the rev martin luther king sr and alberta williams king birth records for martin luther king jr list his first name as michael apparently due to some confusion on the part of the family doctor regarding the true name of king s father who was known as mike throughout his childhood he graduated from morehouse college with a bachelor of arts degree in sociology in one nine four eight at morehouse king was mentored by president benjamin mays a civil rights leader later he graduated from crozer theological seminary in chester pennsylvania with a bachelor of divinity degree in one nine five one in one nine five five he received his ph d in systematic theology from boston university king married coretta scott on june one eight one nine five three king s father performed the wedding ceremony in scott s parents house in marion alabama king and scott had four children yolanda denise november one seven one nine five five montgomery alabama martin luther iii october two three one nine five seven montgomery alabama dexter scott january three zero one nine six

and opinions differ on january three zero two zero zero six king s wife coretta scott king passed away civil rights activism in one nine five three king became the pastor of the dexter avenue baptist church in montgomery alabama he was a leader of the one nine five five montgomery bus boycott that began when rosa parks refused to comply with the jim crow law that required her to give up her seat to a white man the boycott lasted for three eight two days the number of days is often quoted as three eight one but that overlooks the fact that one nine five six was a leap year the situation became so tense that king s house was bombed king was arrested during this campaign which ended with a united states supreme court decision outlawing racial segregation on intrastate buses following the campaign king was instrumental in the founding of the southern christian leadership conference sclc in one nine five seven a group created to harness the moral authority and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform king continued to dominate the organization until his death the organization s nonviolent principles were criticized by some blacks and challenged by the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc the sclc derived its membership principally from black communities associated with baptist churches king was an adherent of the philosophies of nonviolent civil disobedience used successfully in india by mahatma gandhi and he applied this philosophy to the protests organized by the sclc king correctly recognized that organized nonviolent protest against the racist system of southern segregation known as jim crow laws would lead to extensive media coverage of the struggle for black equality and voting rights indeed journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by southern blacks and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers and marchers produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that made the civil rights movement the single most important issue in american politics in the early one nine six zero s martin luther king jr was photographed by alabama police following his february one nine five six arrest during the montgomery bus boycotts the historic mug shot taken when king was two seven was discovered in july two zero zero four by a deputy cleaning out a montgomery county sheriff s department storage room it is unclear when the notations dead and four four six eight were written on the picture king organized and led marches for blacks right to vote desegregation labor rights and other basic civil rights most of these rights were successfully enacted into united states law with the passage of the civil rights act of one nine six four and the voting rights act of one nine six five king and the sclc applied the principles of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the method of protest and the places in which protests were carried out in often dramatic stand offs with segregationist authorities sometimes these confrontations turned violent king and the sclc were instrumental in the unsuccessful protest movement in albany in one nine six one one nine six two where divisions within the black community and the canny low key response by local government defeated efforts in the birmingham protests in the summer of one nine six three and in the protest in st augustine florida in one nine six four king and the sclc joined forces with sncc in selma alabama in december one nine six four where sncc had been working on voter registration for a number of months stance on affirmative action martin luther king jr may have supported affirmative action among his comments whenever this issue compensatory treatment is raised some of our friends recoil in horror the negro should be granted equality they agree but should ask for nothing more on the surface this appears reasonable but is not realistic for it is obvious that if a man enters the starting line of a race three hundred years after another man the second would have to perform some incredible feat in order to catch up a society that has done something special against the negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis for one five centuries the negro was enslaved and robbed of any wages potential accrued wealth which would have been the legacy of his descendants all of america s wealth today could not adequately compensate its negroes for his centuries of exploitation and humiliation it is an economic fact that a program such as i propose would certainly cost far less than any computation of two centuries of unpaid wages plus accumulated interest in any case i do not intend that this program of economic aid should apply only to the negro it should benefit the disadvantaged of all races as one site puts it king actually suggested it might be necessary to have something akin to discrimination in reverse as a form of national atonement for the legacy of slavery and jim crow segregation scholars argue whether he advocated affirmative action for the poor blacks or both king himself admitted that the vast majority of the poor were black anyway implying that he could put his proposed programs in terms of class and not race while still achieving the end of compensatory treatment albeit via a more agreeable position while it may seem that he alternates between advocating socioeconomic and racial affirmative action the latter predominated the march on washington king and sclc in partial collaboration with sncc then attempted to organize a march from selma to the state capital of montgomery for march two five one nine six three the first attempt to march on march seven was aborted due to mob and police violence against the demonstrators this day since has become known as bloody sunday bloody sunday was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of king s nonviolence strategy king however was not present after meeting with president lyndon b johnson he had attempted to delay the march until march eight but the march was carried out against his wishes and without his presence by local civil rights workers the footage of the police brutality against the protesters was broadcast extensively across the nation and aroused a national sense of public outrage the second attempt at the march on march nine was ended when king stopped the procession at the edmund pettus bridge on the outskirts of selma an action which he seemed to have negotiated with city leaders beforehand this unexpected action aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement the march finally went ahead fully on march two five with the agreement and support of president johnson and it was during this march that willie ricks coined the phrase black power widely credited to stokely carmichael king is perhaps most famous for his i have a dream speech given in front of the lincoln memorial during the one nine six three march on washington for jobs and freedom king representing sclc was among the leaders of the so called big six civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the march on washington for jobs and freedom in one nine six three the other leaders and organizations comprising the big six were roy wilkins naacp whitney young jr urban league a philip randolph brotherhood of sleeping car porters john lewis sncc and james farmer of the congress of racial equality core for king this role was another which courted controversy as he was one of the key figures who acceded to the wishes of president john f kennedy in changing the focus of the march kennedy initially opposed the march outright because he was concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation but the organizers were firm that the march would proceed the march originally was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the south and a very public opportunity to place organizers concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation s capital organizers intended to excoriate and then challenge the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks generally in the south however the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone as a result some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate sanitized pageant of racial harmony malcolm x called it the farce on washington and members of the nation of islam who attended the march faced a temporary suspension the march did however make specific demands an end to racial segregation in public school meaningful civil rights legislation including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment protection of civil rights workers from police brutality a two minimum wage for all workers and self government for the district of columbia then governed by congressional committee despite tensions the march was a resounding success more than a quarter of a million people of diverse ethnicities attended the event sprawling from the steps of the lincoln memorial onto the national mall and around the reflecting pool at the time it was the largest gathering of protesters in washington s history king s i have a dream speech electrified the crowd it is regarded along with president lincoln s gettysburg address as one of the finest speeches in the history of american oratory throughout his career of service king wrote and spoke frequently drawing on his long experience as a preacher his letter from birmingham jail written in one nine six three is a passionate statement of his crusade for justice on october one four one nine six four king became the youngest recipient of the nobel peace prize which was awarded to him for leading non violent resistance to end racial prejudice in the united states bayard rustin african american civil rights activist bayard rustin counseled king to dedicate himself to the principles of non violence in one nine five six and had a leadership role in organizing the one nine six three march on washington however rustin s open homosexuality and support of democratic socialism and ties to the communist party usa caused many white and african american leaders to demand that king distance himself from rustin which he did on several occasions but not all such as when he ensured rustin s role in the march on washington chicago in one nine six six after several successes in the south king and other people in the civil rights organizations tried to spread the movement to the north with chicago as its first target king and ralph abernathy both middle class folk moved into chicago s slums as an educational experience and to demonstrate their support and empathy for the poor abernathy could not stand the slums and secretly moved out after a short period king stayed and wrote about how coretta and his children suffered emotional problems from the horrid conditions and inability to play outside in chicago abernathy would later write they received a worse reception than they had received in the south thrown bottles and screaming throngs met their marches and they were truly afraid of starting a riot king had always felt a responsibility to the people he was leading he would not unnecessarily stage a violent event something personal to him as a radical social leader of the one nine six zero s or any other decade if king had intimations that a peaceful march would be put down with violence he would call it off for the safety of people but he himself still faced death many a time by marching at the front in the face of death threats to his person and in chicago the violence was so formidable it shook the two friends but worse than the violence was the two facedness of the city leaders abernathy and king secured agreements on action to be taken but this action was largely bureaucratically killed after the fact by politicians within mayor richard j daley s corrupt machine some of their small successes such as operation breadbasket did not translate into anything as large as the desegregation cases of the bus boycott in the south however they did light the fire of ideas like affirmative action and organizing labor as legitimate techniques in the minds of the people when king and his allies returned to the south they left jesse jackson then a young chicago activist in charge of their organization while jackson had a great deal of heart and oratorical skill he knew very little about running an organization they asked him for financial information and he sent them a bag of unorganized receipts chicago could be seen as a point where the civil rights movement lost its momentum and began to fade to a shadow of what king had planned for it further challenges starting in one nine six five king began to express doubts about the united states role in the vietnam war on april four one nine six seven exactly one year before his death king spoke out strongly against the us s role in the war insisting that the us was in vietnam to occupy it as an american colony and calling the us government the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today but he also argued that the country needed larger and broader moral changes a true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth with righteous indignation it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the west investing huge sums of money in asia africa and south america only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries and say this is not just king was long hated by many white southern segregationists but this speech turned the more mainstream media against him time called the speech demagogic slander that sounded like a script for radio hanoi a propaganda radio station run by the north vietnamese army during the vietnam war and the washington post declared that king had diminished his usefulness to his cause his country his people the speech was a reflection of king s evolving political advocacy in his later years sparked in part by his affiliation with and training at the progressive highlander research and education center king began to speak of the need for fundamental changes in the political and economic life of the nation toward the end of his life king more frequently expressed his opposition to the war and his desire to see a redistribution of resources to correct racial and economic injustice though his public language was guarded so as to avoid being linked to communism by his political enemies in private he sometimes spoke of his support for democratic socialism you can t talk about solving the economic problem of the negro without talking about billions of dollars you can t talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums you re really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then you are messing with captains of industry now this means that we are treading in difficult water because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism there must be a better distribution of wealth and maybe america must move toward a democratic socialism frogmore s c november one four one nine six six speech in front of his staff king also stated in his beyond vietnam speech that true compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring from vietnam to south africa to latin america king said the u s was on the wrong side of a world revolution king questioned our alliance with the landed gentry of latin america and asked why the u s was suppressing revolutions of the shirtless and barefoot people in the third world instead of supporting them in one nine six eight king and the sclc organized the poor people s campaign to address issues of economic justice the campaign culminated in a march on washington d c demanding economic aid to the poorest communities of the united states he crisscrossed the country to assemble a multiracial army of the poor that would descend on washington engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience at the capitol if need be until congress enacted a poor people s bill of rights reader s digest warned of an insurrection king s economic bill of rights called for massive government jobs programs to rebuild america s cities he saw a crying need to confront a congress that had demonstrated its hostility to the poor appropriating military funds with alacrity and generosity but providing poverty funds with miserliness on april three one nine six eight king prophetically told a euphoric crowd it really doesn t matter what happens now some began to talk about the threats that were out what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers like anybody i would like to live a long life longevity has its place but i m not concerned about that now i just want to do god s will and he s allowed me to go up to the mountain and i ve looked over and i ve seen the promised land i may not get there with you but i want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land and so i m happy tonight i m not worried about anything i m not fearing any man mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord assassination the lorraine motel where rev king was assassinated now the site of the national civil rights museum king was assassinated the next evening april four one nine six eight at six zero one pm on the balcony of the lorraine motel in memphis tennessee while preparing to lead a local march in support of the predominantly black memphis sanitation workers union who was on strike at the time friends inside the motel room heard the shot fired and ran to the balcony to find king shot in the throat he was pronounced dead at st joseph s hospital at seven zero five pm the assassination led to a nationwide wave of riots in more than six zero cities five days later president lyndon johnson declared a national day of mourning for the lost civil rights leader a crowd of three zero zero zero zero zero attended his funeral that same day lbj did not attend and instead sent vice president hubert humphrey because he was meeting with several advisors and cabinet officers on the vietnam war in camp david and on fears he may be hit with protests and abuses over the war two months after king s death escaped convict james earl ray was captured at london s heathrow airport while trying to leave the united kingdom on a false canadian passport in the name of ramon george sneyd ray was quickly extradited to tennessee and charged with king s murder confessing to the assassination on march one zero one nine six nine though he recanted this confession three days later later ray would be sentenced to a nine nine year prison term ray a presumed white supremacist and segregationist allegedly killed king because of the latter s extensive civil rights work on the advice of his attorney percy foreman ray took a guilty plea to avoid a trial conviction and thus the possibility of receiving the death penalty although it is unlikely that a death sentence would have been carried out due to the u s supreme court s one nine seven two decision in the case of furman v georgia that invalidated all state death penalty laws then in force ray fired foreman as his attorney from then on derisively calling him percy fourflusher claiming that a man he met in montreal canada with the alias raoul was involved as was his brother johnny but not himself further asserting that although he didn t personally shoot dr king he may have been partially responsible without knowing it hinting at a conspiracy he spent the remainder of his life attempting unsuccessfully to withdraw his guilty plea and secure the trial he never had allegations of conspiracy some have speculated that ray had been used as a patsy similar to the way that alleged john f kennedy assassin lee harvey oswald was supposed to have been some of the claims used to support this assertion are ray was a small time thief and burglar and had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon the weapon that ray is believed to have used in the assassination a remington gamemaster model seven six zero three zero zero six caliber rifle had only two of ray s fingerprints on it according to several fellow prison inmates ray had never expressed any political or racial opinions of any kind casting doubt on ray s purported motive for committing the crime the rooming house bathroom from which ray is said to have fired the fatal shots did not have any of his fingerprints at all ray was believed to have been an average marksman and it is claimed by many that ray had not fired a rifle since his discharge from the u s army in the late one nine four zero s many suspecting a conspiracy in the assassination point out the two separate ballistic tests conducted on the remington gamemaster had neither conclusively proved ray had been the killer nor that it had even been the murder weapon moreover witnesses surrounding king at the moment of his death say the shot came from another location from behind thick shrubbery near the rooming house not from the rooming house itself shrubbery which had been suddenly and inexplicably cut away in the days following the assassination also ray s petty criminal history had been one of colossal and repeated ineptitude he d been quickly and easily apprehended each time he committed an offense behavior in sharp contrast to that of his shortly before and after the shooting he d easily managed to secure several different pieces of legitimate identification using the names and personal data of living men who all coincidentally looked like and were of about the same age and physical build as ray he spent large sums of cash and traveled overseas without being apprehended at any border crossing even though he had been a wanted fugitive according to ray all of this had been accomplished with the aid of the still unidentified raoul investigative reporter louis lomax had also discovered the missouri department of corrections shortly after ray s april one nine six seven prison escape had sent the incorrect set of fingerprints to the fbi and had failed to notice or correct this error lomax had been publishing a series of investigative stories on the king assassination for the north american newspaper alliance stories challenging the official view of the case and had been reportedly pressured by the fbi to halt his investigation according to a former pemiscot county missouri deputy sheriff jim green who claimed to have been part of an fbi led conspiracy to kill dr king ray had been targeted as the patsy for the king assassination shortly before his april one nine six seven prison escape and had been tracked by the bureau during his year as a fugitive after several trips to and from canada and mexico during this time ray had gone to memphis after agreeing to participate allegedly controlled by his mysterious benefactor raoul who reportedly had weeks before while in birmingham alabama ordered ray to purchase the remington gamemaster rifle in what he was told was a major bank robbery while king was in town since city police resources would be dedicated toward maintaining security for king and his entourage the intended bank heist would be much simpler than usual green who like ray had asserted that fbi assistant director cartha deloach headed the assassination plot had claimed ray had been ordered to stay in the rooming house and as a diversion for the purported bank heist to then hold up a small diner near the rooming house at approximately six zero zero p m on april four th dr king was shot a minute later by a sniper hidden in the shrubbery near the rooming house meanwhile according to green two men one of them allegedly a memphis police detective were waiting to ambush and kill ray while ray was on his way to the planned diner holdup and then plant the remington rifle in the trunk of ray s pale yellow not white one nine six six ford mustang effectively framing a dead man however moments before the assassination ray had apparently suspected a setup and instead quickly left town in his mustang heading for atlanta georgia atlanta police found ray s abandoned mustang six days after king had been shot ray and six other convicts escaped from brushy mountain state penitentiary in petros tennessee on june one zero one nine seven seven shortly after ray testified that he did not shoot king to the house select committee on assassinations but were recaptured on june one three and returned to prison more years were then added to his sentence for attempting to escape from the penitentiary recent developments in one nine nine seven martin luther king s son dexter king met with ray and publicly supported ray s efforts to obtain a trial in one nine nine nine coretta scott king king s wife and a civil rights leader herself along with the rest of king s family won a wrongful death civil trial against loyd jowers and other unknown co conspirators jowers claimed to have received one zero zero zero zero zero to arrange king s assassination the jury of six whites and six blacks found jowers guilty and that governmental agencies were parties to the assassination plot dr william pepper represented the king family in the trial in two zero zero zero the department of justice completed the investigation about jowers claims but did not find evidence to support the allegations about conspiracy the investigation report recommends no further investigation unless some new reliable facts are presented jesse jackson who was with king at the time of his death noted the fact is there were to disrupt the march and within our own organization we found a very key person who was on the government payroll so infiltration within saboteurs from without and the press attacks i will never believe that james earl ray had the motive the money and the mobility to have done it himself our government was very involved in setting the stage for and i think the escape route for james earl ray king biographer david garrow disagrees with william f pepper s claims that the government killed king he is supported by king assassination author gerald posner king and the fbi john f kennedy in the oval office with various civil rights activists including martin luther king second from left king had a mutually antagonistic relationship with the federal bureau of investigation fbi especially its director j edgar hoover who had deeply detested the civil rights leader the fbi began tracking king and the sclc in one nine six one its investigations were largely superficial until one nine six two when it learned that one of king s most trusted advisers was new york city lawyer stanley levison the bureau of investigation suspected that levison had been involved with the communist party usa to which another key king lieutenant hunter pitts o dell was also linked by sworn testimony before the house un american activities committee huac the bureau placed wiretaps on levison and king s home and office phones and bugged king s rooms in hotels as he traveled across the country the bureau also informed then attorney general robert f kennedy and then president john f kennedy both of whom unsuccessfully tried to persuade king to dissociate himself from levison for his part king adamantly denied having any connections to communism stating at one point that there are as many communists in this freedom movement as there are eskimos in florida to which hoover responded by calling king the most notorious liar in the country the attempt to prove that king was a communist was in keeping with the feeling of many segregationists that blacks in the south were happy with their lot but had been stirred up by communists and outside agitators movement leaders countered that voter disenfranchisement lack of education and employment opportunities discrimination and vigilante violence were the reasons for the strength of the civil rights movement and that blacks had the intelligence and motivation to organize on their own huac later was discredited for its coercion of witnesses and the manner in which it sought to implicate individuals with vague and often sweeping accusations and assumptions of guilt by association the committee was renamed in one nine six nine and eventually abolished later the focus of the bureau s investigations shifted to attempting to discredit king through revelations regarding his private life fbi surveillance of king some of it since made public demonstrates that he also engaged in numerous extramarital sexual affairs further remarks of king s lifestyle were made by several prominent officials such as president lyndon b johnson who notoriously said that king was a hypocrite preacher the bureau distributed reports regarding such affairs to the executive branch friendly reporters potential coalition partners and funding sources of the sclc and king s family the bureau also sent anonymous letters to king threatening to reveal information if he didn t cease his civil rights work finally the bureau s investigation shifted away from king s personal life to intelligence and counterintelligence work on the direction of the sclc and the black power movement on january three one one nine seven seven in the cases of bernard s lee v clarence m kelley et al and southern christian leadership conference v clarence m kelley et al united states district judge john lewis smith jr ordered all known copies of the recorded audiotapes and written transcripts resulting from the fbi s electronic surveillance of king between one nine six three and one nine six eight be held in the national archives and sealed from public access until two zero two seven across from the lorraine motel next to the rooming house in which james earl ray was staying was a vacant fire station the fbi was assigned to observe king during the appearance he was planning to make on the lorraine motel second floor balcony later that day and utilized the fire station as a makeshift base using papered over windows with peepholes cut into them the agents watched over the scene until martin luther king was shot immediately following the shooting all six agents rushed out of the station and were the first people to administer first aid to dr king their presence nearby has led to speculation that the fbi was involved in the assassination awards and recognition besides winning the one nine six four nobel peace prize in one nine six five the american jewish committee

zero th century according to gallup authorship issues beginning in the one nine eight zero s questions have been raised regarding the authorship of king s dissertation other papers and his speeches though not widely known during his lifetime most of his published writings during his civil rights career were ghostwritten or at least heavily adapted from his speeches concerns about his doctoral dissertation at boston university led to a formal inquiry by university officials which concluded that approximately a third of it had been plagiarized from a paper written by an earlier graduate student but it was decided not to revoke his degree as the paper still makes an intelligent contribution to scholarship such uncredited textual appropriation as king scholar clayborne carson has labeled it was apparently a habit of king s begun earlier in his academic career it is also a feature of many of his speeches which borrowed heavily from those of other preachers and white radio evangelists while some political opponents have used these findings to criticize king most of the scholars in question have sought to put them into broader context for example keith miller probably the foremost expert on language borrowing in king s oratory has argued that the practice falls within the tradition of african american folk preaching and should not necessarily be labeled plagiarism

in american history today he is often compared with abraham lincoln with supporters remarking that both men were leaders who strongly advanced human rights against poor odds in a nation divided against itself on the issue and were ultimately assassinated in part for it even accusations of marital infidelity communism and academic have not seriously damaged his public reputation but merely reinforced the image of a very human hero and leader it is true that king s movement faltered in the latter stages after the great legislative victories were won by one nine six five the voting rights act and the civil rights act but even the sharp attacks by more militant blacks see black power movement and even such prominent critics as muslim leader malcolm x have not diminished his stature on

and founder of higher ground productions an organization specializing in diversity training king s name and legacy have often been invoked since his death as people have begun to debate where he would have stood on various modern political issues were he alive today for example there is some debate even within the king family as to where he would have stood on gay rights issues although king s widow coretta has said publicly that she believes her husband would have supported gay rights his daughter bernice believes he would have been opposed to them the king center lists homophobia as an

modulo for other uses modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers where numbers wrap around after they reach a certain value the modulus modular arithmetic was introduced by carl friedrich gauss in his book disquisitiones arithmeticae published in one eight zero one one way to understand modular arithmetic is to consider clock arithmetic the arithmetic of hours on the clock face if the time is noted at seven o clock and then again eight hours later then rather than ending at one five o clock as in usual addition the time will actually be three o clock albeit one day later likewise if the clock starts at noon and seven hours elapses three times three seven then the time will be nine o clock rather than two one since the time starts over at one after passing one two this is similar to arithmetic modulo one two except that normal modular arithmetic would begin at zero and roll over after one one the two four hour clock which goes from zero zero zero zero to two three five nine is a closer approximation to modular arithmetic using a modulus of two four the congruence relation two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n if a and b have the same remainder when divided by n or equivalently that their difference a b is a multiple of n in this case it is expressed as a b mod n for instance three eight one four mod one two because three eight one four two four which is a multiple of one two for positive numbers congruence can also be thought of as asserting that two numbers have the same remainder after dividing by the modulus n so three eight one four mod one two because when divided by one two both numbers give two as remainder congruence is an equivalence relation and the equivalence class of the integer a is denoted by a n this set of all integers congruent to a modulo n is called the congruence class or residue class of a modulo n and is also denoted by hat if a one b one mod n and a two b two mod n then a one a two b one b two mod n and a one a two b one b two mod n this observation underpins modular arithmetic this is the prototypical example of a congruence relation in simpler terms given any positive integer n and any non negative integer a if a is divided by n the result can be expressed as an integer quotient q and an integer remainder r modular arithmetic is only interested in the remainder or residue after division by some modulus and results with the same remainder are regarded as equivalent or congruent two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n if a mod n b mod n the ring of congruence classes one can then define formally an addition and multiplication on the set z n z of all equivalence classes by the following rules a n b n a b n a n b n ab n in this way z n z becomes a commutative ring with n elements for instance in the ring z one two z we have eight one two six one two two one two the notation z n z is used because it is the factor ring of z by the ideal n z containing all integers divisible by n in terms of groups the residue class a n is the coset of a in the quotient group z n z a cyclic group the set z n z has a number of important mathematical properties that make it the foundation of many different branches of mathematics where n zero z n z does not have zero elements rather it is isomorphic to z since a zero this seemingly counterintuitive special case follows from the definitions and is useful for example when discussing the characteristic of a ring remainders the notion of modular arithmetic is related to that of the remainder in division the operation of finding the remainder is known as the modulo operation and is sometimes written as mod so we write one four mod one two two this meaning of mod is subtly but significantly different from that introduced in this article it is true to say three eight one four mod one two but it is not true to say three eight one four mod one two three eight is congruent to one four modulo one two but the remainder of one four divided by one two is two not three eight to avoid this confusion the congruence relation is sometimes expressed by using modulo instead of mod like three eight one four modulo one two in computer science when working with modular arithmetic each equivalence class is usually represented with its least non negative member which is called the common residue this can be found using long division applications modular arithmetic is referenced in number theory group theory ring theory abstract algebra cryptography computer science and the visual and musical arts it is one of the foundations of number theory touching on almost every aspect of its study and provides key examples for group theory ring theory and abstract algebra in cryptography modular arithmetic directly underpins public key systems such as rsa and diffie hellman as well as providing finite fields which underlie elliptic curves and is used in and a variety of symmetric key algorithms including idea and rc four in computer science modular arithmetic is often applied in operations involving binary numbers and other fixed width cyclic data structures the modulo operation as implemented in many programming languages and calculators is an application of modular arithmetic that is often used in this context in the visual arts modular arithmetic can be used to create artistic patterns based on the multiplication and addition tables modulo n see external link below in music modular arithmetic is used in the consideration of the twelve tone equally

this article is about the number for the typeface see myriad typeface myriad is a classical greek name for the number one zero four one zero zero zero zero or a group of one zero zero zero zero people etc in english the word refers to one zero zero zero zero a cardinal number or to an unspecified large quantity the term myriad is a progression in the commonly used system of describing numbers using tens and hundreds for example one names small numbers in terms of number of tens plus the remainder e g seven six is seventy six or seven tens plus six this system works until ten tens which requires a new description a hundred one similarly names numbers less than one zero zero zero zero by counting the number of hundreds plus the rest e g one seven seven six is seventeen hundred and seventy six this system works until one hundred hundred which again requires a new name a myriad similarly the system using myriads works up to a myriad myriad or one hundred million which was left as the largest named number by the ancient greeks and is also the largest named number in the bible a myriad is primarily a singular cardinal number just as the thousand in four thousand is singular one does not write four thousands people the word myriad is used in the same way there are four myriad people outside when used as a noun meaning a large number it follows the same rules as that phrase there are also words in other languages with the same classic meaning as myriad hebrew revava chinese wan four mandarin and maan six cantonese japanese man korean man chinese japanese and korean also have words for a myriad squared one zero zero zero zero two yi oku and eok pronounced awk respectively a myriad cubed one zero zero zero zero three is a zhao cho a myriad to the fourth power one zero zero zero zero four is a jing kei conversely chinese japanese and korean do not have single words for a thousand squared cubed etc unlike english the english numbering system divides large numbers into groups of three digits and so the names for such numbers follow this division one zero zero zero zero ten thousand asian numbering divides large numbers into groups of four so in chinese japanese or korean

which mosquitos find unappealing or that the vitamin b content wards off the flying pests british travellers to tropical locations sometimes take marmite with them to eat during the trip although there is no proven basis for the belief the root of this belief might have been its use during the one nine three four one nine three five malaria epidemic in sri lanka the two things given to each patient were a bottle of the standard quinine mixture and marmite rolled into the form of vederala s pills the latter was said to have been the idea of the late dr mary ratnam and to have been more effective than the quinine itself such was the degree of starvation among the peasantry the suriya mal workers were amazed to see how this little marmite revived them and put some life back into them serving suggestions marmite is traditionally eaten as a savoury spread on bread and commonly toast due to its concentrated taste it should be spread thinly with butter or margarine its powerful taste limits its applications otherwise nonetheless in two zero zero three the absolute press published paul hartley s the marmite cookbook containing recipes and suggestions on how to blend marmite with

also been used by walkers crisps for a special edition flavour in new zealand it is sometimes spread thinly on bread with packet potato chips added to make a marmite and chip sandwich or spread thickly on bread prior to toasting cooked then eaten slathered with butter in sri lanka it is dissolved in boiling water and some lime juice and a fried sliced onion are added this is an excellent

stores elsewhere marmite is still quite unknown and not marketed by unilever it is however available over the internet where the small size and weight of its containers its long shelf life and its robustness make it practical for mail order marmite in australasia the variety of marmite available in australia and new zealand is significantly different in taste from uk marmite and comes in

frequency one ghz to one mm three zero zero ghz however the boundaries between far infrared light microwaves and ultra high frequency radio waves are fairly arbitrary and are used variously between different fields of study a credible definition comes from pozar s text microwave engineering which states that the term microwave refers to alternating current signals with frequencies between three

successfully throughout the early one nine nine zero s until a serious crash in one nine nine two at assen the netherlands he suffered permanent serious damage to his right leg due to medical complications and at one stage risked amputation of the leg at the time doohan was six five points in the lead of the championship but could not compete for eight weeks after the crash after an arduous recovery doohan returned to racing for the final two races but could not prevent yamaha rider wayne rainey from winning his third consecutive title the thunder from down under a mick doohan biography by mat oxley throughout one nine nine three he struggled to regain fitness and the ability to race the honda at elite level however in one nine nine four he won his first five zero zero cc world championship from then until one nine nine eight he dominated the class winning five consecutive five zero zero cc world championships in one nine nine seven his most successful year doohan won one two out of one five races finishing second in the other three despite up to eight rivals on almost identical honda motorcycles unlike agostini who very often had the advantage of a bike far superior to any of his rivals doohan s margin of superiority over them was such that in many races doohan would build a comfortable lead and then ride well within his limits to cruise to victory although pure riding skill clearly played a large part in his success his ability to perfect the suspension and geometry of a racing motorcycle gave him an enormous advantage over his rivals even though other honda riders particularly doohan s teammates benefited somewhat from his ability to perfect the bike s handling it is generally accepted that his development of the honda throughout the one nine nine zero s helped the company to dominate racing for many years at the time of doohan s retirement the honda had developed into a much better handling machine than it had ever been previously one notable trait of doohan s post crash riding style was the use of a hand operated rear brake which he operated by a nudge bar on the left handlebar some commentators have argued that this technique offered doohan an additional advantage in rear brake control though there was nothing to stop other riders from trying it and some did in one nine nine nine doohan had another accident this time in qualifying he again broke his leg and subsequently announced his retirement he was somewhat unlucky as his accident rate was far lower than many competitors after his retirement he worked as a roving adviser to honda s grand prix race effort at the conclusion of the two zero zero four season doohan and honda parted company mick is known with numerous nicknames the most common of which

yoshiyuki tomino and is made up of four three episodes that were aired in one nine seven nine the series was later re edited for theatrical release and split into three movies in one nine eight one the idea of mobile suit came from the powered suit of starship troopers although the story otherwise bears little resemblance to that novel yoshikazu yasuhiko did the character designs and kunio okawara was responsible for the mechanical designs including the titular giant robot the rx seven eight two gundam background the series was not popular when it first aired and was in fact cancelled before the series was intended to end while the ratings for the show were not bad the merchandising was the series was originally set to run for five two episodes and was cut down to three nine by the show s sponsors which included the original toymakers for the series luckily the staff was able to negotiate a one month extension to end the series with four three episodes when bandai received the licensing to the show s mecha however things changed completely with the introduction of their line of gundam models the popularity of the show began to soar the models sold very well and the show began to do very well in reruns and even better in its theatrical compilation audiences were expecting another giant robot show and instead found ms gundam the first work of anime in an entirely new genre the mecha drama or the real robot genre as opposed to the super robot genre much like the original star trek the original gundam was not appreciated by its initial audience and also like star trek proceeded to spawn a massive sci fi franchise spawning numerous sequels model kits and videogames up to the present day mobile suit gundam premiered on monday july two three two zero zero one on cartoon network s toonami in the us but didn t do so well following the pattern of its initial airing in japan it was later cancelled before the entire series was shown when the september one one two zero zero one attacks occurred the series was almost over immediately following the attacks cartoon network and many other stations began pulling war themed and violent programming although cowboy bebop came back before too long mobile suit gundam did not perhaps it had not been earning high enough ratings to justify returning the series for so few remaining episodes however the last episode was shown as part of toonami s new year s eve il special on december three one two zero zero one it is sometimes stated that msg was cancelled because of the september one one two zero zero one attacks while this is likely why it was taken off initially it is not sufficient to explain why the show didn t return aside from fan speculation the source of this meme seems to be an anonymous report which appeared on the fansite gundam com on september one four purporting to summarize an internal cartoon network memo this report can be seen in the internet wayback machine in two zero zero two the series was given another chance by cartoon network in their late night adult swim block but it was again pulled before completing its run in both american tv showings and on the american dvd release episode one five cucuruz doan s island was cut out it was felt even by tomino that this episode was not up to par with the rest of the series and so it was never dubbed making it into a lost episode of sorts episodes note these episodes do not use the american episode numberings which excludes the original episode one five gundam rising destroy gundam vote to attack escape from luna ii re

of the original gundam anime series the novels issued as a series of three books allowed him to depict his story in a more sophisticated adult and detailed fashion the biggest difference between the anime series and the novels is that in the latter amuro ray is killed in the final attack against the zeonic stronghold by a stray shot of bazooka from a rick dom char aznable and the crew of pegasus ii white base along with handpicked men under kycilia zabi s command make a deep penetrating attack against the side three and together kill gihren zabi after which kycilia is killed by char tomino later lamented that had he known that anime ending would be different and that another series would be made he would not have killed off amuro in the novels because of such significant deviations from the animated series movies and subsequent sequals the novels themselves are not considered cannonical however the detailed account of past events leading up to the introduction of the mobile suit and early skirmishes of the oyw are more or less accepted in the continuity nonetheless they are often enjoyed by fans because they provide a great deal of detail and help explain the philosophical underpinnings of the gundam series the three novels were translated into english by frederik schodt and published by del rey books in september one nine nine zero at the time there were no officially recognized romanizations of character and mecha names and a variety of different spellings were being used in the english language fan community in the original three novels therefore mr schodt wrote the name char as sha sha is a transliteration of the japanese pronunciation although mr tomino later publicly confirmed at anime expo new york two zero zero two that the name was originally based on the french name charles aznavour a one nine seven zero s lounge singer interestingly the two zero zero four edition of the english translation revealed that schodt felt that the char rendering seemed too close to aznavour s name he also rendered zaku as zak and after consulting with mr tomino jion as zeon instead of zion which was in use in some circles some north american fans already attached to particular spellings took great umbrage at schodt s renditions forgetting that in the original japanese most character and mecha names are in a phonetic script known as katakana and that there were therefore no official spellings many years later when the gundam series was finally licensed in north america the rights holders did come up with a unified list of official spellings for english language material and some of these spellings include schodt s renditions as well as the renditions to which certain north american fans were attached in two zero zero four frederik schodt revised his original translation of the books which had been out of print for nearly a decade what had been a three volume set in the one nine nine zero del rey edition was rereleased by stone bridge press as one single volume of four seven six pages with a vastly improved cover design titled mobile suit gundam awakening escalation confrontation since the rights holders in japan by this time had created a unified although still evolving list of romanized character and mecha names schodt was able to use it and amuro s rival in the novel thus became char and not sha the popular zeon mobile suit similarly became zaku and not zak source frederik l schodt compilation movies following the success of the mobile suit gundam tv series yoshiyuki tomino returned in one nine eight one and reworked the footage into three separate compilation movies the first two movies mobile suit gundam and mobile suit gundam soldiers of sorrow were released in one nine eight one the third movie mobile suit gundam encounters in space was released in one nine eight two each of the three movies are largely composed of old footage from the tv series however tomino felt that some things could be changed for the better tomino removed several aspects of the show which he felt were still too super robot esque for the real robot series he intended gundam to be such as the gundam hammer weapon the g armor upgrade parts were also completely removed and replaced in the narative by the more realistic core booster support fighters and hayato receives a guncannon at jaburo to replace the disadvantaged guntank the third movie also includes a substantial amount of new footage expanding on the battles of solomon and a baoa qu the three compilation movies were released both separately and in a box set in america

depth information and large screenshot gallery images on gundam universal century series shows on toonami the methodist movement is a group of historically related denominations of protestant christianity the wesleyan revival the methodist revival originated in england it was started by a group of men including john wesley and his younger brother charles as a movement within the church of england in the one eight th century focused on bible study and a methodical approach to scriptures and christian living the term methodist was a pejorative college nickname that was bestowed upon a small society of students at oxford who met together between one seven two nine and one seven three five for the purpose of mutual improvement they were accustomed to communicate every week to fast regularly and to abstain from most forms of amusement and luxury they also frequently visited poor and sick persons and prisoners in the jail the early methodists reacted against perceived apathy in the church of england became open air preachers and established methodist societies wherever they went they were notorious for their enthusiastic sermons and often accused of fanaticism in those days members of the established church feared that the powerful new doctrines promulgated by the methodists such as the necessity to salvation of a new birth of justification by faith and of the constant and sustained action of the holy spirit upon the believer s soul would produce ill effects upon weak minds theophilus evans an early critic of the movement even wrote that it was the natural tendency of their behaviour in voice and gesture and horrid expressions to make people mad in one of his prints william hogarth likewise attacked methodists as enthusiasts full of credulity superstition and fanaticism but the methodists resisted the many attacks against their movement see john wesley and george whitefield for a much more complete discussion of early methodism john wesley came under the influence of the moravians and dutch theologian jacobus arminius while whitefield adopted calvinistic views consequently their followers separated those of whitefield becoming calvinistic methodists generally methodists have followed wesley in arminian theology separation from the church of england wesley originally had no intention of separating from the church of england however following the american revolution the church of england cut off its american members and refused to ordain ministers for them wesley sent thomas coke to be superintendent of the methodist people in america but since coke was not a bishop this role put him at odds with the anglican church s principle of episcopalian church governance coke and other early american methodist leaders subsequently formed the methodist episcopal church wesley however never ceased to be or to act as a priest of the church of england and died an anglican he chartered the first methodist church on february two eight one seven eight four theology and liturgy traditionally methodism has believed in the arminian view of free will via god s prevenient grace as opposed to predestination this distinguishes it historically from calvinist traditions such as presbyterianism however in strongly calvinist areas such as wales calvinistic methodists remain also called the presbyterian church of wales also more recent theological debates have often cut across denominational lines so that theologically liberal methodist and reformed churches have more in common with each other than with more conservative members of their own denominations john wesley was not a systematic theologian though methodist ministerial students and trainee local preachers do study his sermons for his theology the popular expression of methodist theology is in the hymns of charles wesley since enthusiastic congregational singing was a part of the evangelical movement wesleyan theology took root and spread through this channel methodism follows the traditional and near universal christian belief in the triune god father son and holy spirit in devotional terms this confession is said to embrace the biblical witness to god s activity in creation encompass god s gracious self involvement in the dramas of history and anticipate the consummation of god s reign for them there are two sacraments ordained of christ baptism and communion supper of the lord it is a traditional position of the church that any disciplined theological work calls for the careful use of reason by reason it is said one reads and interprets scripture by reason one determines whether one s christian witness is clear by reason one asks questions of faith and seeks to understand god s action and will this church insists that personal salvation always involves christian mission and service to the world scriptural holiness entails more than personal piety love of god is always linked with love of neighbor a passion for justice and renewal in the life of the world in liturgical matters whereas most methodist worship is modeled after the book of common prayer a unique feature of the american methodist church is its observance of the season of kingdomtide which encompasses the last one three weeks before advent thus dividing the long season after pentecost into two discrete segments during kingdomtide methodist liturgy emphasizes charitable work and alleviating the suffering of the poor a second distinctive liturgical feature of methodism is the use of covenant services although practice varies between different national churches most methodist churches annually follow the call of john wesley for a renewal of their covenant with god it is not unusual in methodism for each congregation to normally hold an annual covenant service on the first convenient sunday of the year and wesley s covenant prayer is still used with minor modification in the order of service it is a striking and sobering piece of liturgical writing as the following excerpts illustrate christ has many services to be done some are easy others are difficult some bring honour others bring reproach some are suitable to our natural inclinations and temporal interests others are contrary to both yet the power to do all these things is given to us in christ who strengthens us i am no longer my own but yours put me to what you will rank me with whom you will put me to doing put me to suffering let me be employed for you or laid aside for you exalted for you or brought low for you let me be full let me be empty let me have all things let me have nothing i freely and wholeheartedly yield all things to your pleasure and disposal methodism in britain main article methodist church of great britain wesley memorial church a methodist church in oxford where the wesley brothers studied british methodism does not have bishops it has however always been characterised by a strong central organization the connexion which holds an annual conference note that the church retains the one eight th century spelling connexion for many purposes the connexion is divided into districts in the charge of a chair who may be male or female methodist districts often correspond approximately in geographical terms to the dioceses of the church of england the districts are divided into circuits governed by the quarterly circuit meeting and led and administrated principally by a superintendent minister and ministers are appointed to these rather than to individual churches though some large inner city churches known as central halls are designated as circuits in themselves westminster central hall opposite westminster abbey in central london is the best known most circuits have many fewer ministers than churches and the majority of services are led by lay local preachers or by retired supernumerary ministers the superintendent and other ministers are assisted in the leadership and administration of the circuit by lay circuit stewards who collectively with the ministers form what is normally known as the circuit leadership team schisms within the original methodist church and independent revivals led to the formation of a number of separate denominations calling themselves methodist the largest of these were the primitive methodist church deriving from a revival at mow cop in staffordshire the bible christians and the united methodist church not connected with the american denomination of the same name but a union of three smaller denominations the original church became known as the wesleyan methodist church to distinguish it from these bodies the three major streams of british methodism united in one nine three two to form the current methodist church of great britain in the one nine six zero s the methodist church made ecumenical overtures to the church of england aimed at church unity formally these failed when they were rejected by the church of england s general synod in one nine seven two conversations and co operation continued however leading in two zero zero three to the signing of a covenant between the two churches from the one nine seven zero s onward the methodist church also started several local ecumenical projects leps both with the church of england and with the united reformed church which involved sharing churches schools and in some cases ministers traditionally methodism proved particularly popular in wales and cornwall both regions noted for their non conformism and distrust of the church of england see also one nine zero four one nine zero five welsh revival and welsh methodist revival methodism in the united states the united methodist cross adopted in one nine six eight is known as the cross and flame the cross represents christ while the flame represents the holy spirit of pentecost the first american methodist bishops were thomas coke and francis asbury whose boyhood home bishop asbury cottage in sandwell england is now a museum upon the formation of the methodist episcopal church in america at the baltimore christmas conference in one seven eight four coke already ordained in the church of england ordained asbury a deacon elder and bishop each on three successive days circuit riders many of whom were laymen traveled by horseback to preach the gospel and establish churches until there was scarcely any crossroad community in america without a methodist expression of christianity one of the most famous circuit riders was robert strawbridge who lived in the vicinity of carroll county maryland soon after arriving in the colonies around one seven six zero disputes over slavery placed the church in difficulty in the first half of the one eight zero zero s with the northern church leaders fearful of a split with the south and reluctant to take a stand the wesleyan methodists later became the wesleyan church and the free methodist churches were formed by staunch abolitionists and the free methodists were especially active in the underground railroad which helped to free the slaves finally in a much larger split in one eight four five at louisville the churches of the slaveholding states left the methodist episcopal church and formed the methodist episcopal church south the northern and southern branches were reunited in one nine three nine when slavery was no longer an issue in this merger also joined the methodist protestant church some southerners conservative in theology and strongly segregationist opposed the merger and formed the southern methodist church in one nine four zero methodist world peace commission administered two civilian public service units during world war ii one was at duke university hostpital in durham north carolina and the other at cherokee state psychiatric hospital in cherokee iowa with six seven three conscientious objectors there were more methodist men in civilian public service than any other denomination excluding the historic peace churches the united methodist church was formed in one nine six eight as a result of a merger between the evangelical united brethren and the methodist church the former church had resulted from mergers of several groups of german methodist heritage there was no longer any need or desire to worship in the german language the merged church had approximately nine million members as of the late one nine nine zero s while united methodist church in america membership has been declining associated groups in developing countries are growing rapidly american methodist churches are generally organized on a connectional model related but not identical to that used in britain ministers are assigned to churches by bishops distinguishing it from presbyterian government methodist denominations typically give lay members representation at regional and national meetings conferences at which the business of the church is conducted making it different from episcopalian government this connectional organizational model differs further from the congregational model for example of baptist and congregationalist churches among others in addition to the united methodist church there are over four zero other denominations that descend from john wesley s methodist movement some such as the african methodist episcopal church the free methodists and the wesleyan church formerly wesleyan methodist are explicitly methodist others do not call themselves methodist but are related to varying degrees the salvation army was founded by william booth a former methodist it derives some of its theology from methodism another related denomination is the church of the nazarene some of the charismatic or pentecostal churches such as the pentecostal holiness church and the assemblies of god also have roots in or draw from wesleyan thought the holiness revival was primarily among people of methodist persuasion who felt that the church had once again become apathetic losing the wesleyan zeal some important events of this revival were the writings of phoebe palmer during the mid one eight zero zero s the establishment of the first of many holiness camp meetings at vineland new jersey in one eight six seven and the founding of asbury college one eight nine zero and other similar institutions in the us around the turn of the two zero th century from its beginnings in england methodism laid emphasis on social service and education numerous originally methodist institutions of higher education were founded in the united states in the early half of the one nine th century and today altogether there are about twenty universities and colleges named as methodist or wesleyan still in existence the united methodist church allows for a wide range of theological and political beliefs for example republican president george w bush is a member vice president dick cheney attends the united methodist church though he is not a member democrats hillary clinton and john edwards are both members of the united methodist church other countries an estimated seven five million people worldwide belong to the methodist community in australia the methodist church merged with the majority of the presbyterian church of australia and the congregational union of australia in one nine seven seven becoming the uniting church the wesleyan methodist church of australia continues to operate independently there are also other independent methodist congregations some of these were established by or have been impacted by tongan immigrants in canada the methodist church of canada was an one eight eight four union of pioneering groups in one nine two five they merged with a large number of presbyterians most congregationalists union churches in western canada and the american presbyterian church in montreal to form the united church of canada in one nine six eight the evangelical united brethren church s canadian congregations joined after their american counterparts joined the united methodist church bermuda s methodist synod is a separate presbytery of the united church of canada s maritime conference there are small methodist churches in many european countries the strongest being in germany these mostly derive from links with the american rather than the british church the strongest methodist church in the world is probably now in south korea there are many korean language methodist churches in north america catering to korean speaking immigrants not all of which are named as methodist there are several denominations which are of wesleyan methodist heritage but not explicitly methodist a high proportion of the polynesian population of fiji are methodists fiji has the highest percentage of methodists in the world missionaries from britain north america and australia founded methodist churches in many commonwealth countries these are now independent and many of them are stronger than the former mother churches in addition to the churches these missionaries often also founded schools to serve the local community a good example of such a school is the methodist boys school in kuala lumpur malaysia and the anglo chinese schools methodist girls schools and fairfield methodist schools in singapore almost all methodist churches are members of a consultative body called the world methodist council which has its headquarters at lake

capture games which comes from the general gameplay the best known games of this family in the western world are oware kalah omweso and bao mancala games play a role in many african and some asian societies comparable to that of chess in the west names people unfamiliar with mancala games commonly assume there is a particular game with the name mancala this perception is helped by marketing which often fails to differentiate variations or gives meaningless names like ethiopian or nigerian even names which are rightly associated with certain games such as awari are frequently lifted and applied to different games in fact the name mancala is the arab name commonly given to some games of this type the word comes from the arabic word naqala literally to move this word is used at least in syria lebanon and egypt but is not consistently applied to any one game in the western world mancala is often seen used as a generic name for the game kalah research in english refers to games in the mancala family or mancala games rather than mancala variants which would imply there is one main mancala game on which the others are based adding to the confusion widespread mancala games may go by different names in different regions often with slight rules variations then there are groups that give multiple games the same name sometimes one is intended to be played by men another by women historically researchers have had difficulty separating the rules for games apart from strategic implications or favored setups which has caused additional confusion over which games are distinct or which names refer to the same game because of these considerations and the fact that mancala games have reached the west from these multiple cultures it is difficult to establish what names and rules if any are the proper ones the names of individual games often come from the equipment used for instance bao is the swahili word meaning board general gameplay mancala games share a general gameplay sequence of picking up all seeds from a hole the strategy then sowing seeds one at a time from a hole and capturing based on the state of board this leads to the english phrase count and capture sometimes used to describe the gameplay although the details differ greatly this general sequence applies to all games equipment a stone mancala board equipment is typically a board constructed of various materials with a series of holes arranged in rows usually two or four some games are more often played with holes dug in the earth or carved in stone the holes may be referred to as depressions pits or houses sometimes large holes on the ends of the board called stores are used for holding captured pieces playing pieces are seeds beans stones or other small undifferentiated counters that are placed in and transferred about the holes during play nickernuts are one common example of pieces used board configurations vary among different games but also within variations of a given game for example endodoi is played on boards from two six to two one zero with a two rank board players usually are considered to control their respective sides of the board although moves often are made into the opponent s side with a four rank board players control an inner row and an outer row and a player s seeds will remain in these closest two rows unless the opponent captures them these games are good for getting children interracting and used to counting children can even be encouraged to make the game themselves as follows take two half dozen egg cartons tear the tops off them both and arrange them in a long line lid base base lid you can staple or tape them together if you wish and you can use pebbles or beads as seeds object the object of mancala games is usually to capture more seeds than the opponent sometimes one seeks to leave the opponent with no legal move in order to win sowing align center before sowing align center after sowing at the beginning of a player s turn they select a hole with seeds that will be sown around the board this selection is often limited to holes on the current player s side of the board as well as holes with a certain minimum number of seeds in a process known as sowing all the seeds from a hole are dropped one by one into subsequent holes in a motion wrapping around the board sowing is an apt name for this activity since not only are many games traditionally played with seeds but placing seeds one at a time in different holes reflects the physical act of sowing if the sowing action stops after dropping the last seed the game is considered a single lap game multiple laps or relay sowing is a frequent feature of mancala games although not universal when relay sowing if the last seed during sowing lands in an occupied hole all the contents of that hole including the last sown seed are immediately resown from the hole the process usually continues until sowing ends in an empty hole many games from the indian subcontinent use pussa kanawa laps these are like standard multilaps but instead of continuing the movement with the contents of the last hole filled a player continues with the next hole a pussa kanawa lap move will then end when a lap ends just prior to an empty hole capturing depending on the last hole sown in a lap a player may capture seeds from the board the exact requirements for capture as well as what is done with captured seeds vary considerably among games typically a capture requires sowing to end in a hole with a certain number of seeds or ending across the board from seeds in specific configurations another common way of capturing is to capture the contents of the holes that reach a certain number of seeds at any moment also several games include the notion of capturing holes and thus all seeds sown on a captured hole belong at the end of the game to the player who captured it history the history of mancala is unclear it probably arose in the region of modern ethiopia in the six th or seven th century ad the similarity of some aspects of the game to agricultural activity and the absence of a need for specialized equipment present the intriguing possibility that it could date to the beginnings of civilization itself however there is little verifiable evidence that the game is older than about one three zero zero years some purported evidence comes from the kurna temple graffiti in egypt as reported by parker in one nine zero nine and murray in his board games other than chess however accurate dating of this graffiti seems to be unavailable and what designs have been found by modern scholars generally resemble games common to the roman world rather than anything like mancala although the games existed in pockets in europe it is recorded as being played as early as the one seven th century by merchants in england it has never gained much popularity there exept in the baltic area where once it was a very popular game das bohnenspiel the usa has a larger mancala playing population although many of these players are descendants of enslaved africans perhaps the unfamiliarity with mancala games in the west is in part due to historic prejudice against primitives the assumption being that these games could not require any serious mental skill the one nine six one edition of goren s hoyle which itself ascribes an arab origin to the games perhaps expresses a common sentiment upon discovery of the games depth the anthropologists have not undertaken to explain how it happens that the universal game of primitive peoples is one of pure intellectual skill mancala is wholly mathematical akin to the game of drawing pebbles from a pile in an endeavor to win the last but so complex as to remain a real

maestricht is a municipality and capital of the province of limburg the city is situated on both sides of the meuse river maas in dutch in the south eastern part of the netherlands between belgium and germany the name of city is derived from its latin name trajectum ad mosam meuse crossing referring to the bridge built by the romans under the reign of augustus caesar for years the city has been in a debate with nijmegen over being the oldest city of the netherlands nijmegen was the first city with roman city rights in what is now the netherlands maastricht was the first with medieval city rights a system which evolved to the current system and thanks to the romans the first settlement with city allure however maastricht was without a doubt the first settlement in the netherlands roman sources mention a celtic probably inhabited by the eburones settlement at the location they used for the bridge other sources mention a celtic settlement at a rivercrossing near where now wyck is located institutions located in maastricht include the universiteit maastricht maastricht university the administration of the dutch province of limburg and the bonnefanten museum of art other large employers include enci first dutch cement industry vodafone mercedes benz sappi and pie medical to the south of the city is the hill of st pietersberg which has an old fort and a network of caves within the caves maintain a constant temperature of one zero c and are a hibernation place for bats mushrooms are grown in the caves as well it is possible to visit the caves at certain times by guided tour the caves were formed by digging out the marl that was used to build houses this led to a very extensive network of caves that one could easily get lost in or hide in as was done often most recently during the second world war some people who stayed there for a long time made charcoal wall paintings some of which are genuine pieces of art later the marl was used by enci to make cement in the process a large chunk was removed from one side of the hill the unused material was used to make a new hill d n observant and there is talk to turn the hole into a watersports recreation area in the process of carving out the marl fossils were found most notably one of a mosasaur in one seven eight zero which contrary to popular belief was not a dinosaur that was before any dinosaur fossils were found and the find was so famous it led to naming a six million year epoch after the city the maastrichtian olv pleina railway passes through maastricht that runs south to liege belgium and north into the rest of the netherlands where it has a branch to heerlen the railway line to hasselt is no longer in use although plans exist to restore it maastricht is served by the maastricht aachen airport by car maastricht can be reached within an hour from brussels and in two to three hours from amsterdam in football maastricht is represented by mvv currently playing in the dutch first division carnival is celebrated almost exclusively in the south of the netherlands and most notably in maastricht where not only does the whole city turn into one big party centre during the three days before lent but there is also a special flag the three day rule is traditionally strictly followed with the mooswief a bigger than life puppet representing a market woman being raised in the vrijthof midday sunday and lowered at midnight tuesday to mark the beginning and the end of the festivities however carnival has wide popularity and its discovery by northerners which causes some friction and joking means that if you see people dressed up on saturday you ll know they re not locals the music used to be strictly in dialect each year a new song along with a prince who is in charge for the three days is elected but other types of party music are now around a great deal more that said the carnival song is everywhere not in the least by the in famous zaate herremeniekes drunken brass bands which often still perform surprisingly well many locals save up all year for this the biggest party and definite highlight of the year and the costumes can be very elaborate they re usually not meant to be as flashy as in rio de janeiro but just old rags turned into a joke costume however a lot of work is often put into them and they can still be an impressive sight while sometimes political these costumes are more often than not simply absurd like elsewhere there are parades though they are not the focus of the party it s more about bringing the streets to life by partying it is said some people don t return home and live in the streets for three days on wednesday the costumes are gone but lent is put off just a little longer with the traditional eating of raw herrings accompanied with a free beer or is that the other way around after carnival one is supposed to fast for four zero days until easter which is the original excuse for the partying but hardly anyone does that anymore a substitute sometimes being to give up a bad habit or two history map showing location of maastricht with respect to the belgian border old stone age remains have been found to the west of maastricht between eight zero zero zero zero and two five zero zero zero zero years old at least five zero zero years before the romans came celts lived here at a spot where the river meuse was shallow and therefore easy to cross the romans later built a bridge and a large road to connect the capitals of the nervians and tungri bavay and tongeren with the capital of the ubians cologne basilica of saint servatius saint servatius was the first bishop of the netherlands his tomb in the crypt at the basilica of saint servatius is a favoured place of pilgrimage pope john paul ii visited it in one nine eight four the golden gilt shrine containing some of the saint s relics is carried around the town every seven years during the medieval period these processions caused such rioting that they were forbidden the city remained an early christian bishopric until it lost this position to nearby li ge in the eight th century maastricht developed in the middle ages into a city of dual authority with both the prince bishopric of li ge and the duchy of brabant holding joint sovereignty over the city it received city rights in one two zero four the role of the dukes was occupied by the dutch states general from one six three two onwards when the city was taken from the spanish by frederik hendrik this duality remained in force until the conquest and annexation of the city by the french in one seven nine four skeletons uncovered in a front garden in maastricht in may two zero zero four may be the remains of musketeers who died during a fierce one seven th century

provinces sought independence from the north to form belgium in one eight three zero the garrison in maastricht remained loyal to the dutch king and occupied the city despite anti dutch feelings amongst the population maastricht was was neither dutch nor belgian between one eight three zero and one eight three nine in one eight three nine the treaty of london was imposed on the belgians and the city and the eastern part of limburg despite being geographically and culturally closer to belgium were permanently added to the netherlands because of the resulting eccentric location maastricht was often more focused on belgium and germany than on the rest of the netherlands adding to the distinct non dutch character of the city even now the people of maastricht and the rest of limburg hold

reflecting sphere self portrait in spherical mirror one nine three five maurits cornelis escher leeuwarden june one seven one eight nine eight march two seven one nine seven two in laren was a dutch graphic artist known for his often mathematically inspired woodcuts lithographs and mezzotints which feature impossible constructions explorations of infinity and tessellations youth maurits cornelis or mauk as he was to be nicknamed was born in leeuwarden friesland the netherlands he was the youngest son of civil engineer george arnold escher and his second wife sarah gleichman in one nine zero three the family moved to arnhem where he took carpentry and piano lessons until the age of thirteen from one nine one two until one nine one eight he attended secondary school though he excelled at drawing his grades were generally poor and he was required to repeat the second form in one nine one nine escher attended the haarlem school of architecture and decorative arts he briefly studied architecture but switched to decorative arts and studied under samuel jesserun de mesquita an artist with whom he would remain friends for years in one nine two two escher left the school having gained experience in drawing and particularly woodcutting marriage and later life self portrait one nine four three by m c escher escher travelled to italy regularly in the following years it was in italy that he first met jetta umiker the woman whom he married in one nine two four the young couple settled down in rome and stayed there until one nine three five when the political climate under mussolini became unbearable the family next moved to ch teau d x switzerland where they remained for two years escher who had been very fond of and inspired by the landscape in italy was decidedly unhappy in switzerland so in one nine three seven the family moved again to ukkel a small town near brussels belgium world war ii forced them to move for the last time in january one nine four one this time to baarn the netherlands where escher lived until one nine seven zero most of escher s better known pictures date from this period the sometimes cloudy cold wet weather of the netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his works and only during one nine six two when he endured surgery was there a time when no new images were created escher moved to the rosa spier house in laren in the northern netherlands in one nine seven zero a retirement home for artists where he could have a studio of his own he died at the home on two seven march one nine seven two at seven three years of age escher and umiker had three sons works drawing hands one nine four eight well known examples of his work include drawing hands a work in which two hands are shown drawing each other sky and water in which light plays on shadow to morph fish in water into birds in the sky and ascending and descending in which lines of people ascend and descend stairs in an infinite loop on a construction which is impossible to build and possible to draw only by taking advantage of quirks of perception and perspective he used lithographs and woodcuts as media in his graphic art he portrayed mathematical relationships among shapes figures and space additionally he explored interlocking figures using black and white to enhance different dimensions integrated into his prints were mirror images of cones spheres cubes rings and spirals in addition to sketching landscape and nature in his early years he also sketched insects which frequently appeared in his later work his first artistic work was completed in one nine two two which featured eight human heads divided in different planes later in about one nine two four he lost interest in regular division of planes and turned to sketching landscapes in italy with irregular perspectives that are impossible in natural form relativity one nine five three although not having had a training in mathematics escher s understanding of mathematics was largely visual and intuitive escher s work has a strong mathematical component and more than a few of the worlds which he drew are built around impossible objects such as the necker cube and the penrose triangle many of escher s works employed repeated tilings called tessellations escher s artwork is especially well liked by mathematicians and scientists who enjoy his use of polyhedra and geometric distortions for example in gravity multi colored turtles poke their heads out of a stellated dodecahedron the mathematical influence in his work emerged in about one nine three six when he was journeying the mediterranean with the adria shipping company specifically he became interested in order and symmetry escher described his journey through the mediterranean as the richest source of inspiration i have ever tapped after the journey at the alhambra palace escher tried to improve upon the art works of moors and used geometric grids as the basis for his sketches which then he built on with additional designs mainly animals such as birds and lions his first study of mathematics which would later lead to its incorporation into his art works began with george p lya s academic paper on plane symmetry groups sent to him by his brother berend this paper inspired him to learn the concept of the one seven wallpaper groups plane symmetry groups utilizing this mathematical concept escher created periodic tilings with four three colored drawings of different types of symmetry from this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works for the years following one nine three seven he created woodcuts using the concept of the one seven plane symmetry groups in one nine four one escher wrote his first notebook now publicly recognized called regular division of the plane with asymmetric congruent polygons which detailed his mathematical approach to artwork creation his intention in writing this was to aid himself in progressing the integration of mathematics into art escher is considered a research mathematician of his time because of his documentation with this notebook in this notebook he studied color based division and developed a system of categorizing combinations of shape color and symmetrical properties by studying these areas he explored an area that later mathematicians labeled crystallography an area of mathematics around one nine five six escher explored the concept of representing infinity on a two dimensional plane discussions with canadian mathematician h s m coxeter inspired escher s interest in hyperbolic tessellations which are regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane escher s work circle limit i demonstrates this concept in one nine nine five coxeter verified that escher had achieved mathematical perfection in his etchings in a published paper coxeter wrote escher got it absolutely right to the millimetre escher later completed circle limit ii iii and iv these works continued to demonstrate his ability to create perfectly consistent mathematical designs his works gained him fame he was awarded the knighthood of the order of orange nassau in one nine five five subsequently he regularly designed art for dignitaries around the world in one nine five eight he published a paper called regular division of the plane in which he described the systematic buildup of mathematical designs in his artworks he emphasized mathematicians have opened the gate leading to an extensive domain overall his early love of roman and italian landscapes and of nature led to his interest in regular division of a plane he used the media woodcuts lithographs and mezzotints in his lifetime he created over one five zero colored works utilizing the concept of regular division of a plane other mathematical principals evidenced in his works include hyperbolic plane on a fixed two dimensional plane and application three dimensional objects such as spheres columns and cubes into his works for example in a print called reptiles he combined two and three dimensional images in one of his papers escher emphasized the importance of dimensionality to him and described himself as irritated by flat shapes i make them come out of the plane waterfall one nine six one topology is another mathematical concept he studied in his life topology is the study of properties that are left unchanged by continuous deformation topology is the founding concept for its branches general point set topology algebraic topology and differential topology escher learned additional concepts in mathematics from british mathematician roger penrose from the new knowledge he created waterfall and up and down featuring irregular perspectives similar to the concept of the m bius strip m bius being a mathematician who studied topology escher printed metamorphosis i in one nine three three which was a beginning part of a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures these works demonstrated a culmination of escher s skills to incorporate mathematics into art in metamorphosis i he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif this effect symbolizes his life change of interest from landscape and nature to regular division of a plane one of his most notable works is the piece metamorphosis iii which is wide enough to cover all the walls in a room and then loop back onto itself after one nine five three escher was a lecturer to many organizations a planned series of lectures in north america in one nine six four was cancelled due to illness but the illustrations and text for the lectures written out in full by escher was later published as part of the book escher on escher in july of one nine six nine he finished his last work before his death a woodcut called snakes it features etchings of patterns that fade to infinity both to the center and the edge of a circle snakes transverse the circle and the patterns

the master of kung fu he was created by writer steve englehart and artist jim starlin he has no special superpowers but he exhibits extraordinary skills in the martial arts and is well versed in the use of numerous hand held martial arts weapons including the staff nunchaku and double edged sword the character was conceived in late one nine seven two when marvel comics acquired the comic book rights to sax rohmer s pulp novel villain dr fu manchu while they also held the rights to the kung fu television program instead of producing a straight adaptation of either source the decision was made to combine them the result was shang chi a master of kung fu who was introduced as the previously unheard of son of fu manchu though an original character himself many of shang chi s supporting characters most notably fu manchu and sir denis nayland smith were rohmer creations no characters from the kung fu television series carried over into the comic series though the character lu sung an early issue bears a strong resemblance to kwai chang caine with the addition of a moustashe shang chi first appeared in special marvel edition one five in december one nine seven three by englehart and starlin sme one one four were reprints of older marvel superhero stories shang chi appeared again in issue one six and in issue one seven april one nine seven four the title was renamed to the hands of shang chi master of kung fu amidst the martial arts craze of the united states in the one nine seven zero s the title would prove to be very popular and continue on until issue one two five june one nine eight three in addition to the series run shang chi appeared in five giant size issues marvel team up eight four where he teams with spider man and marvel two in one two nine where teams with the thing shang chi also appeared in marvel s special collector s edition one entitled savage fists of kung fu he also appeared quite prominently in marvel s sister imprint magazine entiteld deadly hands of kung fu the series started by introducing shang chi as a man raised by his father fu manchu to be the ultimate lackey for the would be world conqueror however his first mission which was to kill his father s old archenemy sir denis nayland smith ended with him learning the true evil nature of his father disillusioned shang chi swore eternal opposition to his father s ambitions and fought him as an agent of british intelligence cover of marvel special edition one five first appearance of shang chi master of kung fu cover for the first issue of mokf one seven numerical sequence to mse notice the now in his own mag logo cover for the last issue of mokf one two five cover of the new series master of kung fu one the series was an instant sales success though englehart and starlin quickly left the book the title s success grew even stronger with the coming of writer doug moench and artist paul gulacy who collaborated for the first time on two two their critically acclaimed run went on with short gaps until five one when gulacy was replaced by artist jim craig who in turn was succeeded by mike zeck who became official regular penciller with six four one nine seven eight moench continued on the series for a long tenure though the title did not again receive the same level of acclaim as the gulacy period until gene day who had previously been working on the title as its inker took over the pencilling chores in one zero zero one nine eight one however despite critical success sales started to lag and the title began to be published bi monthly day left the series with one two zero and moench followed after one two two with both departures ascribed to conflicts with editor in chief jim shooter the title was cancelled three issues later shang chi had two more short series the master of kung fu bleeding black graphic novel one nine nine zero and the max miniseries master of kung fu hellfire apocalypse two zero zero two the character also had several stories in the anthology series marvel comics presents including one by moench and gulacy that ran in the series first eight issues in one nine eight eight and co starred in the moon knight special one nine nine two although spun out of licensed properties shang chi is a marvel owned character and has been firmly established as a part of the marvel universe with guest appearances in numerous other titles such as marvel team up marvel knights and x men most of the original licensed characters in the supporting cast have been phased out in the more recent series and stories in some of his modern appearances mention made of his villainous father who has apparently returned from the dead marvel s version of fu manchu was meant to have died in master of kung fu one one eight however fu manchu is never named only referred to as shang s father and is never shown out of shadow as marvel have opted not to renew the licence to the character a feature film the hands of shang chi is in the planning stages with yuen wo ping directing and ang lee producing supporting characters the series especially as written by doug moench was notable for its strong supporting characters as they evolved these characters became nearly as integral to the series as shang chi hmself fu manchu is protrayed in a manner mostly consistent with the sax rohmer novels he is a brilliant and calculating master villain who aspires to rule the world as the series progresses the character deteriorates gradually losing his nobler qualities by the end of the series he is a pathetic figure reduced to stealing his son s blood to preserve his immortality sir denis nayland smith is fu manchu s nemesis from the novels in the comics he retains this role his obsession with the villain often bringing out the dark side of his own character in his better moments he becomes a sort of surrogate father to shang chi ultimately he is too caught up in what shang chi calls games of deceit and death and fails in this role the relationship the two finally form is that of two flawed characters who feel strong friendship in spite of deep differences fah lo suee is the daughter of fu manchu and is the final character from the novels to appear in the comic she is a villainess in her own right though she is not interested in the misguided idealism of fu manchu she is a pragmatist seeking the best way to power as such she shifts alliences often usually she is an enemy of shang chi and his friends but sometimes she is an ally when last seen she had become a highly ranked official in mi six black jack tarr is smith s aide de camp and is a powerful giant of a man with a gruff manner though he is initially an enemy of shang chi the two become close friends over time he exhibits the most bigoted traits of any character and invariably addresses shang chi as chinaman rather than using his name it is one of the successes of the series that readers are drawn to feel for tarr while the writing never turns a blind eye to his ugly attitudes clive reston is a british spy who resembles a younger and more vulnerable version of james bond where bond is a successful womanizer and seems unaffected by heavy drinking reston struggles with alcoholism and a romantic rivalry with shang chi the resemblance to bond is intentional reston s dialogue makes it clear that he is bond s son and the grand nephew of sherlock holmes leiko wu is introduced as a femme fatale like those in the bond films she is a beautiful chinese british woman who is torn between her history with reston and her growing attraction to shang chi though initially sarcastic and self possessed to the point of arrogance leiko is actually a japanese name meaning arrogant her relationship with her new lover causes her to become more contemplative rufus t hackstabber is a memorable character who appeared only twice in the series the character strongly resembles groucho marx and his fast paced nonsensical patter plays well off shang chi s laconic seriousness hackstabber s name is a play on rufus t firefly groucho s character in duck soup shen kuei or cat is a master thief whose skill in martial arts equals shang chi s the meaning of the character s name is both similar and opposite to shang chi s name he is a sort of mirror image a good bad guy in opposition to shang chi s bad good guy while they share mutual respect the two always find themselves in opposition he has recently appeared in cable the keith moon of spy trade and the juston timberlake of the cherry pop club rufus super midnight carter is an african

eskrima fighting system it is one of the three ranges of engagement specifically the closest one note that this does not indicate solely unarmed combat this term has been adopted in english with similar meaning possibly by ernest hemingway the english adoption can be likened to the phrases one on one head to head or single combat it is also commonly misunderstood as a cognate by english speakers who think that the term means man to man violence vocabulary mujahedeen also transliterated as muj hid n mujahedeen mujahedin mujahidin mujaheddin etc is a plural form of mujahid which literally means struggler someone who engages in jihad or struggle but is often translated in the west as holy warrior in the late twentieth century the term mujahedeen became popular in the western media to describe various armed fighters who subscribe to militant islamic ideologies although there is not always an explicit holy or warrior meaning within the word etymology arabic words usually have a three letter root the root of mujahedeen is j h d meaning effort in general however the particular verb stem of j h d from which both jihad and mujahid are derived means to exert effort against or to struggle mujahid is originally therefore someone who struggles the term has even in arabic taken on meanings that are specifically religious or specifically military or paramilitary or both afghan mujahideen the best known and most feared mujahedeen were the various loosely aligned opposition groups that fought against the soviet invasion of afghanistan during the one nine eight zero s and then fought against each other in the following civil war the mujahedeen were provided some support before the soviet invasion according to zbigniew brzezinski in order to have the opportunity to give the soviet union its vietnam after the soviet invasion these mujahedeen were significantly financed armed and trained by the united states under the presidencies of jimmy carter and ronald reagan pakistan saudi arabia and china reagan referred to these mujahedeen as freedom fighters defending principles of independence and freedom that form the basis of global security and stability in western popular culture the mujahedeen were portrayed favourably in the popular actions films the living daylights and rambo iii which was not too different from how the american media portrayed the soviet red army back in wwii following the soviet retreat many of the larger mujahedeen groups began to fight each other after several years of this fighting a village mullah organized religious students into an armed movement with the backing of pakistan who was being funded by the united states which found the existing government to be too russia influenced this movement became known as the taliban meaning students and referring to the saudi backed religious schools which produced islamic fundamentalism along the pacific coast of asia with each success the taliban had their popularity and numbers grew by two zero zero one the taliban with backing from the pakistani isi had defeated most of the militias and controlled most of afghanistan the remaining militias were in the north east of the country they allied themselves together and became known as the national islamic united front for the salvation of afghanistan or the united front or northern alliance a wealthy saudi named osama bin laden was a prominent mujahideen organizer and financier his maktab al khadamat mak office of services funnelled money arms and muslim fighters from around the world into afghanistan with the assistance and support of the saudi government in one nine eight eight bin laden broke away from the mak afghanistan s resistance movement was born in chaos spread and triumphed chaotically and did not find a way to govern differently virtually all of its war was waged locally by regional warlords as warfare became more sophisticated outside support and regional coordination grew even so the basic units of mujahedeen organization and action continued to reflect the highly segmented nature of afghan society in the course of the guerrilla war leadership came to be distinctively associated with the title commander it applied to independent leaders eschewing identification with elaborate military bureaucracy associated with such ranks as general as the war produced leaders of reputation commander was conferred on leaders of fighting units of all sizes signifying pride in independence self sufficiency and distinct ties to local community the title epitomized afghan pride in their struggle against an overwhelmingly powerful foe segmentation of power and religious leadership were the two values evoked by nomenclature generated in the war neither had been favored in ideology of the former afghan state olivier roy estimates that after four years of war there were at least four zero zero zero bases from which mujahedeen units operated most of these were affiliated with the seven expatriate parties headquartered in pakistan which served as sources of supply and varying degrees of supervision significant commanders typically led three zero zero or more men controlled several bases and dominated a district or a sub division of a province hierarchies of organization above the bases were attempted their operations varied greatly in scope the most ambitious being achieved by ahmed shah massoud of the panjshir valley north of kabul he led at least one zero zero zero zero trained troops at the end of the soviet war and had expanded his political control of tajik dominated areas to afghanistan s northeastern provinces under the supervisory council of the north roy also describes regional ethnic and sectarian variations in mujahedeen organization in the pashtun areas of the east south and southwest tribal structure with its many rival sub divisions provided the basis for military organization and leadership mobilization could be readily linked to traditional fighting allegiances of the tribal lashkar fighting force in favorable circumstances such formations could quickly reach more than one zero zero zero zero as happened when large soviet assaults were launched in the eastern provinces or when the mujahideen besieged towns such as khost in paktia province but in campaigns of the latter type the traditional explosions of manpower customarily common immediately after the completion of harvest proved obsolete when confronted by well dug in defenders with modern weapons lashkar durability was notoriously short few sieges succeeded mujahedeen mobilization in non pashtun regions faced very different obstacles prior to the invasion few non pashtuns possessed firearms early in the war they were most readily available from army troops or gendarmerie who defected or were ambushed the international arms market and foreign military support tended to reach the minority areas last in the northern regions little military tradition had survived upon which to build an armed resistance mobilization mostly came from political leadership closely tied to islam roy convincingly contrasts the social leadership of religious figures in the persian and turkish speaking regions of afghanistan with that of the pashtuns lacking a strong political representation in a state dominated by pashtuns minority communities commonly looked to pious learned or charismatically revered pirs saints for leadership extensive sufi and maraboutic networks were spread through the minority communities readily available as foundations for leadership organization communication and indoctrination these networks also provided for political mobilization which led to some of the most effective of the resistance operations during the war many muslims from other countries volunteered to assist various mujahedeen groups in afghanistan and gained significant experience in guerrilla warfare some groups of these veterans have been significant factors in more recent conflicts in and around the muslim world e g bosnia the mujahedeen won when the soviet union pulled troops out of afghanistan in one nine eight nine followed by the fall of the mohammad najibullah regime in one nine nine two however the mujahedeen did not establish a united government and they were in turn ousted from power by a radical splinter group known as the taliban in one nine nine six they regrouped as the afghan northern alliance and in two zero zero one with u s and international military aid they ousted the taliban from power and formed a new government under hamid karzai mujahedeen in bosnia during the bosnian war bosniak forces received financial and military aid from islamic countries this military aid was partially sent in the form of experienced mujahedeen troops a certain number of these mujahedeen fighters stayed in bosnia when the war ended they attained bosnian citizenship and are now living in several villages throughout bosnia where they follow

masturbation is the manual excitation of the sexual organs most often to the point of orgasm it can refer to excitation either by oneself or by another see mutual masturbation but commonly refers to such activities performed alone it is part of a larger set of activities known as autoeroticism which also includes the use of sex toys and non genital stimulation there are also masturbation machines used to simulate intercourse masturbation and sexual intercourse are the two most common sexual practices but they are not mutually exclusive for example many people find the sight of their partner masturbating highly erotic some people are able to achieve orgasm solely by masturbation and without sexual intercourse in the animal kingdom masturbation has been observed in many mammalian species both in the wild and in captivity etymology the word masturbation is believed by many to derive from the greek word mezea penises and the latin turbare to disturb a competing etymology based on the latin manu stuprare to defile with the hand is said by the oxford english dictionary to be an old conjecture the esoteric and little used synonym manustupration is similarly derived from manus stuprare masturbation techniques ways of masturbating common to members of both sexes include pressing or rubbing the genital area either with the fingers or against an object such as a pillow inserting fingers or an object into the anus see anal masturbation and stimulating the penis or vulva clitoris with electric vibrators which may also be inserted into the vagina or anus members of both sexes may also enjoy touching rubbing or pinching the nipples or other erogenous zones while masturbating both sexes sometimes use lubricating substances to intensify sensation reading or viewing pornography or sexual fantasy are common adjuncts to masturbation in adolescence and adulthood masturbation activities are often ritualised various fetishes and paraphilias can also play a part in the masturbation ritual potentially harmful or fatal activities include autoerotic asphyxiation and self bondage female a vibrating duck by de dramatising the nature of a vibrator this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance female masturbation techniques are numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males they are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva especially the clitoris with the middle index and or second fingers sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g spot is located masturbation aids such as a vibrator dildo or ben wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerves located there lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation especially when penetration is involved but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological women may masturbate in the bathtub shower and hot tub sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris lying face down one may straddle a pillow the corner or edge of the bed a partner s leg or some scrunched up clothing and hump the vulva and clitoris against it standing up the corner of an item of furniture or even a washing machine can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs which creates pressure on the genitals this can potentially be done in public without observers noticing some prefer to use only pressure applied to the clitoris without direct contact for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing a few women can orgasm spontaneously after experiencing prior sexual arousal due to intellectual stimulation alone for instance listening to certain pieces of music often these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone but that ability if it exists at all may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm especially if they have not masturbated before male a male masturbating male masturbation techniques are also influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences techniques may also differ between circumcised and uncircumcised males as some techniques which may work for one can often be quite painful for the other the most common technique is to simply hold the penis with a loose fist and then to move the hand up and down the shaft until orgasm is achieved when uncircumcised stimulation of the penis comes from the pumping of the foreskin this gliding motion of the foreskin reduces friction when circumcised the stimulation is sometimes from direct contact with the hand many massage with some using a personal lubricant to reduce friction the glans the rim thereof and the notched indent left over from the removal of the frenulum another technique is to place just the index finger and thumb around the penis about halfway along the shaft and move the skin up and down a variation on this is to place the fingers and thumb on the penis as if playing a flute and then shuttle them back and forth a less common technique is to lie face down on a comfortable surface such as a mattress or pillow and rub the penis against it until orgasm is achieved some people claim such masturbation may result in pain irritation or abrasion if performed too roughly other techniques include the use of an artificial vagina or simulacrum for masturbation many fondle their testicles nipples or other parts of their body with the other hand while masturbating some may use vibrators and other sexual devices more commonly associated with female masturbation the prostate gland is one of the organs that contributes fluid to semen as the prostate is touch sensitive some directly stimulate it using a well lubricated finger or dildo inserted through the anus into the rectum stimulating the prostate from outside via pressure on the perineum can be pleasurable as well ejaculation of semen is sometimes controlled by wearing a condom or by ejaculating onto a tissue or other item a controversial ejaculation control technique is to put pressure on the perineum about half way between the scrotum and the anus just before ejaculating this can however redirect semen into the bladder and the technique may cause long term damage due to the pressure put on the nerves and blood vessels in the perineum a dry orgasm is one that is reached by withholding ejaculation proponents of tantric sex say that this is a learnable skill that can shorten the refractory period drugs such as prolactin inhibitors may also shorten the refractory period for a male an example of this is the prescription drug dostinex males who can reach and stimulate their penis with their tongue or lips are said to be capable of autofellatio some men may taste or swallow their semen historically some have seen a connection between circumcision and masturbation frequency which remains a debated topic in a one four one zero man survey in the united states in one nine nine two laumann found that a total of four seven of circumcised men reported masturbating at least once a month vs three four for their uncircumcised peers masturbation frequency age and sex frequency of masturbation is determined by many factors eg one s ability to resist transient sexual tension hormones levels influencing sexual arousal physiology vol eight six three pp three five six six eight one s attitude to masturbation formed by culture e heiby and j becker examined the latter forty eight female college students were asked to complete a sexual attitudes questionnaire in which a frequency of masturbation scale was embedded twenty four of the women the experimental group then individually viewed an explicit modeling film involving female masturbation one month later all subjects again completed the same questionnaire subjects in the experimental group also completed a questionnaire evaluating aspects of the film results indicated that the experimental group reported a significant increase in the average monthly frequency of masturbation as compared to the control group this same group however reported that the film had no effect on sexual attitudes or behavior it is thought that most people begin masturbating when reaching adolescence many scholarly and clinical studies have been done on the matter and many informal surveys have asked the question a two zero zero four survey by toronto magazine now was answered by an unspecified number of thousands the results show that an overwhelming majority of the males eight one began masturbating between the ages of one zero and one five among females the same figure was a more modest majority of five five note that surveys on sexual practices are prone to self selection bias it is not uncommon however to begin much earlier and this is more frequent among females one eight had begun by the time they turned one zero and six already by the time they turned six being the main outlet of child sexuality masturbation has been observed in very young children in the book human sexuality diversity in contemporary america by strong devault and sayad the authors point out a baby boy may laugh in his crib while playing with his erect penis although he does not ejaculate baby girls sometimes move their bodies rhythmically almost violently appearing to experience orgasm according to the canadian survey of now magazine readers cited above the frequency of masturbation declines after the age of one seven however most males masturbate daily or even more frequently well into their two zero s and sometimes way beyond this decline is more drastic among females and more gradual among males while females aged one three one seven masturbated almost once a day on average and almost as often as their male peers adult women only masturbated eight nine times a month compared to the one eight two two among men it is also apparent that the ability to masturbate declines with age adolescent youths report being able to masturbate to ejaculation six or more times per day while men in middle age report being hard pressed to ejaculate even once per day the survey does not give a full demographic breakdown of respondents however and the sexual history of respondents to this poll who are readers of an urban toronto lifestyle magazine may not extend to the general population in part this is due to the fact that females are less likely to masturbate while in a sexual relationship than men both sexes occasionally engage in this activity however even when in sexually active relationships in general it is believed that individuals of either sex who are not in sexually active relationships tend to masturbate more frequently than those who are however much of the time this is not true as masturbation alone or with a partner is often a feature of a healthy relationship health and psychological effects it is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve depression and lead to a higher sense of self worth masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship both from the standpoint of avoiding unwanted pregnancy and that of avoiding sexually transmitted diseases masturbation is the safest of sexual practices there is no credible scientific or medical evidence that manual masturbation is damaging to either one s mental or physical health on july one six two zero zero three an australian research team led by graham giles of the cancer council published a medical study which concluded that frequent masturbation by males may help prevent the development of prostate cancer the study also indicated that this would be more helpful than ejaculation through sexual intercourse because intercourse can transmit diseases that may increase the risk of cancer instead solitary masturbation carries no risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases masturbation involving both a man and a woman can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva any masturbation with a partner can theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted disease by contact with bodily fluids and such contact should be avoided with any partner whose disease status is uncertain objects inserted into the vagina or anus should be clean and of a kind that will not scratch or break care should be taken not to fully insert anything into the anus any object used should have a flared or flanged base otherwise retrieval can require a visit to the emergency room most modern dildos and anal plugs are designed with this feature a man whose penis has suffered an invasive procedure blunt trauma or injury during intercourse may suffer later in life from peyronie s disease there is the rare event of penile fracture which may occur phimosis is a contracted foreskin that may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back in these cases overly aggressive manipulation of the penis can be problematic repeated masturbation usually leads to a reduced interest in further sexual activity tiredness and sometimes even some soreness these tend to make frequent masturbation self limiting for almost all men and women compulsive masturbation can be part of a sexual addiction syndrome possible issues with prone masturbation traumatic masturbatory syndrome lawrence i sank one nine nine eight speculated that their habit of masturbating prone i e lying face downward was responsible for serious sexual problems including anorgasmia and erectile dysfunction suffered by four men he examined he coined the term traumatic masturbatory syndrome to describe the effect sank reported that his patients were cured of their sexual dysfunction merely by abandoning prone masturbation and learning to masturbate in a supine position using their hands as of two zero zero six there has been no follow up research and the idea that prone masturbation causes male sexual dysfunction is not familiar or widely held within the medical community some sources however do give credence to the idea one sex therapist margolies one nine nine four has condemned masturbation by rubbing against a pillow or mattress lipsith et al two zero zero three suggest that masturbation could play in male psychogenic sexual dysfunction mpsd citing sank as their authority a sex guide joannides two zero zero four quotes an unidentified urologist as saying it seems possible that some men who always masturbate face down have erection problems when trying to have sex with a woman masturbation in history and society antiquity samurai being masturbated by his kagema prostitute early ukiyo e print in the shunga erotic style moronobu hishikawa ca one six eight zero private collection there are depictions of male masturbation in prehistoric rock paintings around the world though these are all entirely matters of interpretation most early people seem to have connected human sexuality with abundance in nature a clay figurine of the four th millennium bc from a temple site on the island of malta depicts a woman masturbating however in the ancient world depictions of male masturbation are far more common male masturbation became an even more important image in ancient egypt when performed by a god it could be considered a creative or magical act the god atum was believed to have created the universe by masturbating to ejaculation and the ebb and flow of the nile was attributed to the frequency of his ejaculations the ancient greeks had a more natural attitude toward masturbation than the egyptians did regarding the act as a normal and healthy substitute for other forms of sexual pleasure they considered masturbation a safety valve against destructive sexual frustration the greeks also dealt with female masturbation in both their art and writings religion in many religions such as conservative protestantism catholicism mormonism and islam masturbation is regarded as a sinful practice in the buddhist tradition under the five precepts and the eightfold path one should neither be attached to nor crave sensual pleasure masturbation is therefore neither forbidden nor encouraged catholicism the catechism of the catholic church lists masturbation as one of the offenses against chastity and calls it an intrinsically and gravely disordered action because use of the sexual faculty for whatever reason outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose it is considered a mortal sin however factors taken into account during the sacrament of reconciliation are social factors psychological factors i e anxiety immaturity and the force of an acquired habit which can lessen the moral culpability for masturbation protestantism protestant theologians only began shunning these teachings toward the middle of the two zero th century with some today even taking pro masturbation viewpoints masturbation however is still viewed in catholic dogma and by many denominations as an act of self indulgence and a sin of the flesh making it a contentious issue to this day it has been reported by rolling stone that a small christian right wing politics group in america is encouraging people to wear a masturband to indicate a commitment to abstinence from masturbation islam in the broadest understanding scholars of islam consider masturbation to be forbidden haraam except in extenuating circumstances ayatollah sistani of iraq writes yes this is forbidden for man to stimulate his genitals for ejaculation as well as for woman it is forbidden to stimulate genitals for orgasm extenuating circumstances masturbation is permissible for the sake of medical tests or if medically necessary doctors make the decision on its necessity in all cases not legal scholars for example sistani remarks on fertility tests as long as it isn t an absolute necessity masturbation is forbidden muslims should not engage in sex outside of marriage yet if one s desire is so overwhelming one might perform a greater wrong by having sex prior to marriage masturbation becomes permissible and those who are not married should try to live in chastity until god enriches them with his grace qur an two four three three masturbation may be permissible so that men and women have a healthy knowledge of their own bodies and so that they may be able to communicate with their marital partner about their sexual needs for a discussion of this see sex on progressiveislam org s women s health project masturbation like any form of sex in which seminal or vaginal fluids have been released breaks one s fast if performed during the daylight hours and requires a major ablution if any seminal or vaginal fluids were released according to sheikh hamed al ali masturbation during the daytime of ramadan breaks the fast based on the hadith that a fasting muslim gives up eating drinking and sexual desire for the sake of allah since masturbation is a kind of sexual desire a fasting muslim must avoid it therefore masturbation invalidates the fast as does food and as it is one of the sins that if someone does it he or she would be violating the sanctity of this month philosophical arguments regarding masturbation immanuel kant regarded masturbation as a violation of the moral law in the metaphysics of morals one seven nine seven he made the a posteriori argument that such an unnatural use of one s sexual attributes strikes everyone upon his thinking of it as a violation of one s duty to himself and suggested that it was regarded as immoral even to give it its proper name unlike the case of the similarly undutiful act of suicide he went on however to acknowledge that it is not so easy to produce a rational demonstration of the inadmissability of that unnatural use but ultimately concluded that its immorality lay in the fact that a man gives up his personality when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive subsequent critics of masturbation tended to argue against it on more physiological grounds however see medical attitudes medical attitudes excerpt from united states patent number seven four five two six four filed on may two nine one nine zero three by albert v todd it describes a

the entire patent document page one two three four excerpt from us patent nine nine five six zero zero by jonas e heyser the entire patent document the first use of onanism to consistently and specifically refer to masturbation appears to be onania an anonymous pamphlet first distributed in london in one seven one six in it was a bombastic but novel tirade drawing on familiar themes of sin and vice this time in particular against the heinous sin of self pollution after dire warnings that those who so indulged would suffer impotence gonorrhea epilepsy and a wasting of the faculties included were letters and testimonials supposedly from young men ill and dying from the effects of compulsive masturbation the pamphlet then goes on to recommend as an effective remedy a strengthening tincture at one zero shillings a bottle and a prolific powder at one two shillings a bag available from a certain shop in london one of the many horrified by the descriptions of malady in onania was the notable swiss physician samuel auguste tissot in one seven six zero he published l onanisme his own comprehensive medical treatise on the purported ill effects of masturbation citing case studies of young male masturbators amongst his patients in lausanne switzerland as basis for his reasoning tissot argued that semen was an essential oil and stimulus that when lost from the body in great amounts would cause a perceptible reduction of strength of memory and even of reason blurred vision all the nervous disorders all types of gout and rheumatism weakening of the organs of generation blood in the urine disturbance of the appetite headaches and a great number of other disorders though tissot s ideas are now considered conjectural at best his treatise was presented as a scholarly scientific work in a time when experimental physiology was practically nonexistent the authority with which the work was subsequently treated tissot s arguments were even acknowledged and echoed by luminaries such as kant and voltaire arguably turned the perception of masturbation in western medicine over the next two centuries into that of a debilitating illness this continued well into the victorian era where such medical censure of masturbation was in line with the widespread social conservatism and opposition to open sexual behavior common at the time there were recommendations to have boys pants constructed so that the genitals could not be touched through the pockets for schoolchildren to be seated at special desks to prevent their crossing their legs in class and for girls to be forbidden from riding horses and bicycles because the sensations these activities produce were considered too similar to masturbation many remedies were devised including eating a bland meatless diet this approach was promoted by dr john harvey kellogg inventor of corn flakes and rev sylvester graham inventor of graham crackers the medical literature of the times describes procedures for electric shock treatments infibulation restraining devices like chastity belts and straitjackets cauterization or as a last resort wholesale surgical excision of the genitals routine neonatal circumcision was widely adopted in the united states and the uk at least partly because of its believed preventive effect against masturbation see also history of male circumcision in later decades the more drastic of these measures were increasingly replaced with psychological techniques such as warnings that masturbation led to blindness hairy hands or stunted growth some of these persist as myths even today medical attitudes toward masturbation began to change at the beginning of the two zero th century when h havelock ellis in his seminal one eight nine seven work studies in the psychology of sex questioned tissot s premises cheerfully named famous men of the era who masturbated and then set out to disprove with the work of more recent physicians each of the claimed diseases

the new orleans saints three three one six but then they would go on to lose their next two road games to the atlanta falcons three zero one zero and their division rival chicago bears two eight three the vikings would win at home against fellow division rival green bay packers two three two zero by winning the same way the packers did last season which was a last second field goal however the vikes had little to celebrate when in the next week not only did they lose to the carolina panthers three eight one three on the road but they would also lose their star qb daunte culpepper for the season with a knee injury taking his place would be brad johnson viking from one nine nine four nine eight and quarterback of the super bowl xxxvii champion buccaneers and ever since he took over he

streak ended with a one eight three loss to the pittsburgh steelers christmas day two zero zero five will go down as a day viking fans would much rather forget after having their chances of winning the nfc north extinguished when the bears defeated the packers earlier in the day the vikings were officially eliminated from nfc playoff contention with a three zero two three loss to the baltimore ravens the vikings won their last game of the two zero zero five season against the bears with a three four one zero victory however the vikings fired head coach mike tice immediately following the

members the m two four nine was one of many firearms fielded in the late one nine seven zero s one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s that was part of the nato adoption of a new smaller round the belgium round ss one zero nine developed for use with the minimi was the winner of the competition for the new standardized five five six mm round in the united states the m one six a two was adopted following the m two four nine as part of the move to this compatible although different round firearms intended to fire the ss one zero nine cartridge use a different rifling twist rate one seven inches from the earlier u s non nato five five six mm round the minimi and the m two four nine are not exactly the same weapon they weigh different amounts and have slightly different configurations m two four nine variants can vary significantly although officially adopted in the early one nine eight zero s some early production problems delayed full deployment until the turn of the decade one thousand minimis were purchased directly from fn for the gulf war in one nine nine one as there were not enough m two four nine yet in service at the time the m two four nine has

of linked five five six x four five mm nato ammunition through the top mounted feed tray or m one six type magazines through the side mounted port linked ammunition can be fed from either a loose belt or from a plastic box or cloth pouch for two zero zero rounds clipped under the receiver the m two four nine saw features a built in bipod and a tripod mounting lug for supported fire as well as a quick change barrel that helps prevent overheating during sustained fire the gun has good firepower for its size the latest reports on failures of m two four nine saw weapons in iraq are sometimes attributed to the age of the weapons used and sometimes to the dusty environment in iraq and afghanistan most of the current issue m two four nine s in u s army are more than one zero years old which is not excessively old for a service firearm but can reduce reliability there have been issues with its performance at other times particularly earlier in its development a marine fires blanks with

blank firing attachment which is the same one used on the m one six a two for the m two four nine to function when firing blank rounds the bfa must be used the basic reason is that the pressure will not be high enough to cycle the gas system u s m two four nine s are sometimes fitted with the m one four five mgo a low power optic that fits on via a top m one nine one three rail when the rail is

births living people manx gaelg or gailck also known as manx gaelic is a goidelic language spoken on the isle of man it is a descendant of old irish particularly similar to the old east ulster and galloway dialects history manx began to diverge from middle irish sometime around nine zero zero one six zero zero ad and is called yn ghaelg yn ghailck by manx speakers the language sharply declined during the one nine th century and was supplanted by english in one eight four eight j g cumming wrote that there are few persons perhaps none of the young who speak no english and henry jenner estimated in one eight seven four that about three zero of the population habitually spoke manx one two three four zero out of a population of four one zero eight four according to official census figures nine one of the population claimed to speak manx in one nine zero one in one nine two one the percentage was only one one since the language had fallen to a status of low prestige parents tended to fail to teach the language to their children thinking that manx would be useless to them compared with english by the middle of the two zero th century only a few elderly native speakers remained the last of them ned maddrell died on december two seven one nine seven four but by then a scholarly revival had begun to spread to the populace and many had learned manx as a second language the first native speakers of manx bilingual with english in many years have now appeared children brought up by manx speaking parents primary immersion education in manx is provided by the manx government since two zero zero three the former st john s school building has been used by the bunscoill gaelgagh manx language medium school degrees in manx are available from the isle of man college the centre for manx studies and the university of edinburgh manx language playgroups also exist and manx language classes are available in island schools in the one nine nine one census six five zero out of a population of about seven one zero zero zero claimed to have knowledge of manx although the degree of knowledge in these cases presumably varied manx is used by the tynwald with new laws being read out by yn lhaihder the reader in both manx and english manx is recognised under the european charter for regional or minority languages it is also one of the regional languages recognised in the framework of the british irish council some controversy has resulted over the omission of manx culture from the columba initiative the revival of manx has been aided by the recording work done in the two zero th century by researchers notably the irish folklore commission in one nine four eight little secular manx literature has been preserved arguably no trace of written manx survives from before the one six zero zero s but the book of common prayer and bible were translated into manx in the one seven th and one eight th centuries a tradition of carvals religious songs or carols developed following the decline in the use of manx during the one nine th century yn cheshaght ghailckagh the manx language society was founded in one eight nine nine today manx is used as the sole medium for teaching at five of the island s pre schools by a group named mooinjer veggey two primary schools bunscoill ghaelgagh and scoill balley cottier manx can be taught as a second language at all of the island s primary and secondary schools and also at the isle of man college and centre of manx studies orthography the spelling of manx unlike that of irish and scottish gaelic does not represent the goidelic etymology and more closely resembles an english speaker s attempt to write gaelic with a degree of welsh influence evident from the use of y and w this is because manx developed without a written literature and when attempts were made to introduce a standardised orthography for the language the choice was made to spell the words in an english manner for example isle of man in irish would be written as oile n mhanainn or in scottish gaelic as eilean mhanainn whereas in manx it is written as ellan vannin although it is commonly said that phillips a welsh speaking bishop introduced the writing system it does appear to have some similarities with similar english based systems that have been found in scotland for example the book of the dean of lismore is written in scottish gaelic using such a system initial consonant mutations many places such as douglas sport bilingual welcome signs note here the consonant mutation of doolish douglas to ghoolish like all modern celtic languages manx shows initial consonant mutations which are processes by which the initial consonant of a word is altered according to its morphological and or syntactic environment the only productive mutation of literary manx is lenition though traces of the eclipsis found in irish can also be found in the late spoken language of the two zero th century the system was breaking down with speakers frequently failing to use lenition in environments where it was called for and occasionally using it in environments where it was not called for vocabulary key sco scottish gaelic irl

languages the marcomanni were a germanic tribe probably related to the suebi or suevi contemporary scholars believe their name derives from one of two possible sources one old germanic forms of march frontier and men or two the tribe has taken on the name of a roman captain named marco romani who deserted the legions of drusus during his campaign in germania of roughly one three bc and was thought to have banded together an essentially ragtag group of germanic tribes into a reasonably cohesive fighting force see pomoerivm vol three one nine nine eight drusus attacked them in nine bc forcing them into present day bohemia in that region their king maroboduus established a powerful kingdom that augustus perceived as a threat to rome before he could act on this the war in illyria intervened eventually maroboduus was deposed and exiled by catualda ad one nine in the two nd century ad they entered into a confederation with other peoples which included the quadi vandals and sarmatians against rome this was driven probably by greater tribal movements like the goths according to the historian eutropius the forces of the emperor marcus aurelius battled against the marcomannic confederation for three years at the fortress of carnuntum in pannonia he compared the war and marcus aurelius success against the marcomanni and their allies to the punic wars the comparison was fair in that this war marked a turning point and had significant roman defeats it began in one six six and lasted to marcus aurelius s death in one eight zero involving the unheard of defeats and the death of two praetorian guard commanders it was in fact only a limited success since from the next century onwards the danube was the main roman battlefront until the collapse of the roman empire in the

arminius the cheruscan leader who inflicted the devastating defeat at the battle of the teutoburg forest on the romans in nine a d prevented a concerted attack on roman territory across the rhine in

soudan two detector in the standard model of particle physics a muon from greek letter mu used to represent it is a semistable fundamental particle with negative electric charge and a spin of one two together with the electron the tau lepton and the neutrinos it is classified as part of the lepton family of fermions like all fundamental particles the muon has an antimatter partner of opposite charge but equal mass and spin the antimuon for historical reasons muons are sometimes referred to as mu mesons even though they are not classified as mesons by modern particle physicists see history muons have a mass of one zero five six mev which is two zero seven times the electron mass since their interactions are very similar to that of the electron a muon can often be thought of as an extremely heavy electron muons are denoted by and antimuons by on earth muons are created when a charged pion decays the pions are created in the upper atmosphere by cosmic radiation and have a very short decay time a few nanoseconds the muons created when the pion decays are also short lived their decay time is two two microseconds however muons in the atmosphere are moving at very high velocities so that the time dilation effect of special relativity make them easily detectable at the earth s surface as with the case of the other charged leptons there is a muon neutrino which has the same flavor as the muon muon neutrinos are denoted by muons naturally decay into an electron an electron antineutrino and a muon neutrino muonic atoms the muon was the first elementary particle discovered that does not appear in ordinary atoms negative muons can however form muonic atoms by replacing an electron in ordinary atoms muonic atoms are much smaller than typical atoms because in order to conserve angular momentum the more massive muon must be closer to the atomic nucleus than its less massive electron counterpart a positive muon when stopped in ordinary matter can also bind an electron and form the muonium mu atom in which the muon acts as the nucleus the reduced mass of muonium hence its bohr radius is very close to that of hydrogen hence this short lived atom behaves chemically in first approximation like its heavier isotopes hydrogen deuterium and tritium history muons were discovered by carl d anderson in one nine three six while he studied cosmic radiation he had noticed particles that curved in a manner distinct from that of electrons and other known particles when passed through a magnetic field in particular these new particles curved to a smaller degree than electrons but more sharply than protons it was assumed that their electric charge was equal to that of the electron and so to account for the difference in curvature it was supposed that these particles were of intermediate mass lying somewhere between that of an electron and that of a proton for this reason anderson initially called the new particle a mesotron adopting the prefix meso from the greek word for intermediate shortly thereafter additional particles of intermediate mass were discovered and the more general term meson was adopted to refer to any such particle faced with the need to differentiate between different types of mesons the mesotron was renamed the mu meson with the greek letter mu used to approximate the sound of the latin letter m however it was soon found that the mu meson significantly differed from other mesons for example its decay products included a neutrino and an antineutrino rather than one or the other as was observed in other mesons
